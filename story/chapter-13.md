Title: "Chapter 13 – Shadows in the Club"
---

The bass thundered through the dimly lit club, lights flashing in waves of crimson and violet as bodies moved in rhythm on the floor. Laughter and chatter mixed with the pulse of the music, and in the middle of it all, Uswa twirled, her dupatta knotted loosely at her wrist.

She leaned close to her younger sister, voice half-drowned by the DJ’s set. “Don’t tell Aama,” Uswa giggled, her hand clutching a half-empty glass.

Huriya, who had been dancing with more restraint, raised her brow, a sly smile tugging at her lips. “I won’t,” she said, “if I can have some.”

Uswa gave her a playful glare before relenting. “Fine... a little. But not too much.” She wagged a finger with exaggerated sternness. “And you will never ever again drink. Swear it.”

Huriya rolled her eyes but nodded, taking a small sip from her sister’s glass. The alcohol burned her throat, but the rebellion in it made her grin.

For a while, the two sisters let themselves sink into the music. Uswa, however, was drifting... her movements looser, her laughter louder, her balance less steady. She stumbled toward the bar to set her glass down, her eyes sweeping lazily across the room.

Then she froze.

At a corner seat in front of the bar, slouched low and cloaked in a black hoodie, sat a man. His head tilted just enough for the strobing lights to catch the curve of his jaw, the shadow of his nose. Something in her chest seized like a hand clutching her heart.

Her head spun, not from the drink but from the rush of memory... blood, sirens, a grave.

*Him.*

Uswa’s body moved before thought could catch up. She stormed forward, her voice breaking out of her like a wild scream.

“You...!”

Huriya stumbled after her, alarm flashing across her face. “Apa! What happened?”

But Uswa wasn’t listening. She lunged, ripping the hood back and yanking the man out of his chair. Her fists came down in a storm, each strike brutal, years of rage exploding all at once.

“You bastard!” she screamed, her voice echoing above the music, silencing those closest to the fight. “How the hell are you out of jail? You killed my husband! You don’t deserve to breathe!”

The man groaned, trying to shield his face, but Uswa was merciless. She kicked, punched, clawed, her hair flying loose, her body trembling with the force of her grief. Gasps rose around them, the crowd pulling back in shock.

A familiar voice cut through the chaos.

“Where the hell did she come from...?”

It was Irfan. He had been sitting only a seat away from the hooded man, his eyes wide, disbelief carved into his features.

But Uswa didn’t hear him. She grabbed a wine glass from the table, smashed it against the floor in one clean strike, and raised the jagged stem high above her head.

“You deserve to die!”

“Uswa... stop!” Irfan lunged forward, his hand clamping tight around her wrist before the glass could descend. Her body shook against his grip, her breath ragged, eyes wild. For a moment, it seemed she might turn the weapon on him.

In that split second, the hooded man scrambled free. Blood ran from his nose as he staggered toward the exit, clutching his ribs.

“Are you serious...?” Irfan cursed, shoving Uswa aside as he bolted after him. The crowd parted in panic, clearing a path to the door.

But by the time Irfan reached the entrance, the man was gone—swallowed by the night, just another shadow dissolving into Mehrabad’s crooked alleys.

Breathless, Irfan stood framed by the doorway, the cold night air rushing in. Behind him, the club was still trembling from the eruption—people staring, whispering, a broken glass glittering like shards of accusation on the floor.

And at the center of it all, Uswa sank to her knees, her hands trembling, her fury dissolving into tears that stung hotter than the alcohol.

The crowd still murmured in shock, phones lifted to record, when the club’s security guards rushed in. Two broad-shouldered men grabbed Uswa by the arms, pulling her back from the mess of broken glass and spilled drinks.

“Calm down, madam! Calm down!” one of them barked, though his grip tightened as if she were a live wire ready to explode again.

“I’m fine!” Uswa snapped, her chest heaving, but her eyes were still fixed on the door where the hooded man had disappeared.

Huriya rushed forward, tugging at the guard’s sleeve. “Please, let her go... she’s not dangerous! She just...” Her voice faltered, not knowing how to explain.

Moments later, the blare of a siren outside cut through the music that had finally stuttered to silence. Two police officers entered, their uniforms catching the neon lights, their faces set in sharp professionalism.

One officer gestured toward Uswa. “What happened here?”

“She attacked a man,” one of the security guards said quickly. “Almost stabbed him.”

The officers exchanged a look, then approached Uswa. “Madam, you’ll need to explain this.”

Uswa’s rage had burned itself out into something quieter, something heavier. She straightened, pulling her dupatta across her shoulders with trembling hands. Her voice, though hoarse, came out polite but firm.

“He is a killer,” she said, each word steady. “Why is he out of jail?”

The room fell still at her question. Even the guards, moments ago so forceful, seemed to hesitate.

The older officer studied her carefully, his tone softening. “We know who you’re talking about. He’s out on bail. He has already spent nearly half of his life in prison.”

Uswa’s lip trembled, her fists tightening at her sides. “And that makes it right?”

The officer shook his head. “No. It means he’s watched. It means if he hurts anyone again, or does something evil, he won’t see bail again. He will hang.”

The promise lingered in the air like a cold wind. Uswa closed her eyes, her breath hitching. The words didn’t soothe her, but they chained her fury long enough for her to nod.

The officers gave a final warning to the sisters before turning away, speaking in low tones with the club’s security. Slowly, the music crept back, people returning to their corners, though their eyes still flicked toward Uswa with curiosity and unease.

And in the middle of it all, Uswa sank back into a chair, her body drained, her heart still screaming in ways no law or bail could silence.

The police spoke with the security one last time, then turned back to the sisters.

“You both should go,” the older officer said firmly. “The matter’s closed for tonight. No more trouble.”

Uswa nodded, her face unreadable. Huriya clutched her wrist, pulling her gently away from the flashing lights of the club and out into the cooler night air.

The ride home was heavy. The city’s noise blurred past the windows, neon lights streaking into the darkness, but inside the car the silence pressed down harder than any sound.

Huriya glanced at her sister again and again, chewing on her lip. Finally, she whispered, “Apa... are you okay?”

Uswa kept her eyes fixed on the road ahead, her face carved in stone. She said nothing.

The silence gnawed at Huriya, twisting her worry tighter with every passing second. She had never seen her sister like this... so furious, so broken, and now so quiet.

By the time they pulled up to their house, the silence felt unbearable. As they stepped out, Huriya reached for her again. “Apa...”

Uswa stopped at the threshold, her hand on the gate. Her voice came low, sharp, carrying an edge that silenced Huriya at once.

“Be careful. Nothing happened back there. You are not going to tell anything to Aama.”

The finality in her tone chilled Huriya. She swallowed her words, nodded, and followed her sister inside, the night’s shadows trailing after them.
