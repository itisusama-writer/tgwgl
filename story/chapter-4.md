Title: "Chapter 4 – The Suggestion"
---

The evening breeze moved gently through the verandah as Aama watched her youngest granddaughter pace restlessly. Uswa’s thin frame carried a tension that no words could ease. Every few minutes, she would pause near the main gate, glance toward the road, then quickly retreat, as if the world outside had grown hostile and unfamiliar.

“Uswa beti, why don’t you go for a short walk?” Aama said, her voice carrying the soft firmness of concern. “The air will clear your mind.”

Uswa shook her head instantly. “I can’t,” she whispered.

Huriya, who had been quietly observing from the corner, rose and slipped her arm through her sister’s. “She can’t go alone, Aama. Not yet.”

And so, with Huriya beside her, Uswa allowed herself to step outside. Her grip on Huriya’s hand was tight, her eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting them to move. They made only a short round of the street, but by the time they returned, beads of sweat clung to her forehead despite the cool night.

Inside, Huriya helped her settle. The room was dim, the quiet hum of the ceiling fan filling the silence. She sat beside Uswa and, after a pause, spoke gently.

“Aama,” she said, turning toward the elder, “maybe what Uswa needs is more than just walks around the lane. She needs a change of place... a change of air.”

Aama adjusted her shawl. “What do you have in mind?”

“Gulraiz hill station,” Huriya answered at once. “It’s not too far, and it’s quiet. Fresh air, pine trees, no noise of the city... maybe she’ll feel lighter there.”

Aama considered it, her wrinkled brow furrowed with thought. Slowly, she nodded. “Perhaps you are right. Let me talk to the others.”

That night, a ripple of cautious excitement spread through the Rizvi household. The idea of leaving the heavy atmosphere behind, of escaping the suffocating walls that reminded Uswa of her grief, seemed to brighten everyone. Plans were whispered, bags pulled out, and clothes folded neatly in piles.

By dawn, the house buzzed with unusual energy. Huriya packed for both herself and Uswa, slipping in a few of her sister’s favorite shawls, while Aama made sure no one forgot the thermos of chai or the carefully wrapped parathas for the road. 

When the car pulled up to the gate, laughter replaced the usual hush of mourning. Suitcases were loaded, farewells exchanged with the neighbors, and soon the family was seated inside, the engine rumbling to life.

Uswa sat pressed close to Huriya, her hands folded in her lap in the backseat. Through the window, the streets of Mehrabad rolled past shops opening their shutters, children in uniforms hurrying to school, fruit vendors arranging their carts. Each sight slipped by like fragments of a life she could no longer reach.

She leaned her head slightly toward the glass, her eyes far away. While the rest of the family chatted, pointing out landmarks and joking over the radio, Uswa remained silent. Her reflection stared back at her from the window, pale and uncertain, while beyond it the horizon stretched toward the hills.

Huriya gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “We’re going to be fine,” she murmured.

But Uswa did not answer. She only watched the road, the trees, the unfamiliar faces, as though searching for something she feared might appear at any moment.

And so, with hope in their hearts but unease in Uswa’s eyes, the Rizvi family drove onward to Gulraiz, toward pine-scented air, toward a fragile chance of healing.
