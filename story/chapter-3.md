Title: "Chapter 3 – Shadows at Night"
---

The Rizvi house had grown too quiet. Even the ticking of the old clock in the hallway seemed heavy, each beat a reminder of something pressing down on them all.

Uswa sat on the corner of her bed, knees pulled close, eyes darting toward the window as though the shadows outside were alive. Aama entered with a glass of warm milk, her brows drawn in worry.

“Beta, drink this. It will help you sleep,” Aama said softly, placing the glass on the bedside table.

Uswa shook her head, voice trembling. “No, Aama... sleep is when he comes closer. I feel him... everywhere.”

Aama sat beside her, brushing a hand over Uswa’s hair. “Who, beta? Who are you talking about?”

Uswa leaned forward, whispering so faintly that Aama had to bend down to catch her words.
“Aama... he killed Harim. He is going to kill me too.”

Aama’s face tightened. She held her daughter’s hands firmly. “Uswa, don’t say such things. You are safe here.”

Uswa’s eyes widened, glassy with fear. “Safe? No, Aama. He watches me... even now. In the walls, in the streets... when I close my eyes, he whispers. I can hear his footsteps. He’s here.”

From the doorway, Huriya had been straining to catch the words. She stepped closer, exasperated. “Apa, can you be a bit louder? I can’t hear anything from there.”

Uswa turned sharply, almost startled. “Don’t! Don’t ask me to speak louder. If I do, he’ll hear me!”

Huriya bit her lip, uneasy, and looked to Aama. “Aama, this isn’t good. She’s... not herself.”

Aama nodded, concern deepening. She pulled Uswa into her arms, rocking her gently like a child. “Beta, listen to me. We’ll go to Risha baji’s clinic. She’ll help you. Hmm?”

Uswa’s hands clutched her mother’s kurta tightly. “Now? At night?” Her eyes flickered toward the window again, as if expecting a figure to be standing there.

“Yes, now,” Aama said firmly. “We can’t wait till morning.”

Huriya, still hesitant, asked, “But Aama... is Risha baji even back home? You know she sometimes stays late at the hospital.”

“She’s home tonight,” Aama replied quickly, almost as if convincing herself. “And even if she isn’t, we’ll wait outside her house. I cannot see Uswa like this.”

Within minutes, they had wrapped shawls around themselves and stepped out into the dimly lit street. Uswa clung tightly to Aama’s arm, every shadow seeming to make her stumble. The rustle of leaves, the bark of a stray dog, the distant hum of a motorbike—all made her flinch.

When they reached Risha’s gate, Uswa’s steps faltered. She clutched Aama’s wrist. “Don’t knock, Aama. What if he’s inside already? What if he got to her too?”

Aama squeezed her hand. “Shh, beta. Nothing will happen. We are here together.”

With that, Aama lifted the latch and called softly, “Risha... are you awake?”

A light flicked on inside. Footsteps approached.

And in that moment, as the door creaked open, Uswa whispered under her breath, “He followed us.”

Perfect — let’s extend **Chapter 3** into **Chapter 3.2** with the new material you asked for. This section carries over the tension of the night but shifts into Risha’s calm, clinical voice while also bringing in Irfan as a parallel case.

The yellow glow of Risha’s hallway lamp spilled across the veranda as she opened the door, her hair tied back hastily, a shawl thrown over her shoulders. Her brows furrowed at the sight of Aama and Huriya holding Uswa between them.

“Ya Allah, what happened?” Risha whispered, immediately ushering them in.

Uswa shrank from the doorway as though it were some threshold into danger. Aama had to coax her forward.

“Come, beta. We are safe here,” Aama murmured.

Inside, Risha guided them toward her small sitting room, where a half-read medical journal lay open on the side table. She pulled the cushions together and gently made Uswa sit down.

“Uswa, look at me,” Risha said softly, her voice steady in contrast to the storm in the girl’s eyes. “You are trembling. Breathe with me... slow, like this.”

She demonstrated, inhaling and exhaling deliberately. Uswa tried, but her chest rose and fell too quickly, eyes darting toward the curtained window.

“He followed us, Risha baji,” Uswa whispered hoarsely. “I know he’s here. You can’t see him, but he’s here. He killed Harim... and I’m next.”

Risha leaned forward, clasping Uswa’s cold hands between her warm ones. “No one followed you. This is your fear talking, not reality. You are safe inside my house. Do you trust me?”

Tears spilled from Uswa’s eyes, and she nodded faintly.

Huriya folded her arms, shifting uncomfortably. “Apa, you have to speak louder. We can’t keep guessing what you’re saying.”

“Let her be, Huriya,” Risha said gently, throwing her a glance. “She doesn’t need to raise her voice. She just needs to feel heard.”

Aama sighed. “That’s what I’ve been telling her... but she won’t rest. I thought of no one but you tonight, Risha beta.”

Risha reached for a glass of water and pressed it into Uswa’s hands. “Sip this. Slowly.”

For a long moment, the room was silent except for the ticking of Risha’s wall clock. Then Risha said quietly, as though thinking aloud, “You know... this reminds me of Irfan Kaleem. He came to my clinic all the time... couldn’t write. Said he felt eyes on him all the time. Imagined someone was watching through the windows. A mind under siege by its own fears.”

Huriya’s head snapped up, curious. “The writer? The one I read?”

“Yes,” Risha confirmed, her gaze still on Uswa. “But Irfan’s fears were born of exhaustion, stress, too much pressure over his writing. He needed rest, a slower rhythm, space away from the typewriter.” She turned her attention back to Aama. “But Uswa’s case... it feels different. She’s not imagining because of fatigue. Her fear is consuming her whole being.”

Aama’s lips trembled. “Then what do we do?”

Risha smoothed Uswa’s hair, calming her. “First, she needs change. These walls, this routine, the familiar shadows, everything in Mehrabad reminds her of her fear. Take her away for a while. Somewhere with light, new air, safe company. That will help more than locking her in these fears.”

Uswa’s grip on Aama’s arm tightened. “No... no leaving. He will find me wherever I go.”

Risha shook her head firmly but kindly. “That’s what your mind is telling you. But the truth is, you need a break from these thoughts. You won’t be running away... you’ll be giving yourself a chance to breathe again.”

Huriya, arms still crossed, muttered, “She can’t even whisper without panicking... how will she handle a journey?”

“Step by step,” Risha replied calmly. “One night at a time. We’ll find a way.”

Aama drew her daughter close. “Beta, did you hear? Risha baji is right. You need a little change, even if it’s just for a while.”

Uswa closed her eyes, as if summoning courage. “If you go with me, Aama... maybe.”

Risha smiled faintly, relieved at the small crack in her resistance. “Good. That’s all we need for tonight... a maybe.”

The room fell quiet again, but this time the silence was softer, less suffocating. For the first time that night, Uswa’s breathing began to steady.
