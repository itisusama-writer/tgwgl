Title: "Chapter 9 - Towards the Writer"
---

Uswa sat cross-legged on her bed, the soft glow of her phone screen lighting up her face. Her brows were drawn tight, eyes scanning line after line of search results. Every click, every refresh carried the same intent... finding him. Irfan Kaleem.

The name pulsed in her mind like a wound that refused to close. Finally, a link gave her what she wanted: an address scribbled into the small notepad she kept beside her pillow. She tore the page out, folded it sharply, and slipped it into her bag.

Her movements grew swift, deliberate. She reached for the small backpack leaning against her wardrobe, stuffing in a scarf, her charger, and a half-folded notebook. Zipping it shut, she swung it over her shoulder, her breath quickening with a strange mix of anger and courage.

Downstairs, the house carried its usual late-evening hush. The ceiling fan whirred, the faint clink of cups from the kitchen drifted in, but in the hallway Aama and Huriya stood in quiet conversation. Uswa’s steps broke their rhythm, her presence sharp enough to draw both their eyes at once.

From the far end of the hall, Risha appeared, adjusting her dupatta as she walked toward them. Her gaze landed on Uswa, and a crease of confusion softened into surprise.

“Uswa...” Risha slowed, her voice warm but wary. “Where are you going?”

Uswa’s grip tightened on her backpack straps. “Baji... that writer—” her voice trembled, then hardened, “...Irfan Kaleem. He did a really nasty thing. I’m going to talk to him.”

Before anyone could answer, she raised her voice, sharp and commanding in a way that silenced the hall.

“Aaba! Give me your car keys!”

The words hung heavy. Even Aama flinched at the sudden edge in her tone. Risha blinked, stunned, her mouth parting slightly as if to ask something... but she didn’t. She looked instead at Aama, then Huriya, her expression a storm of disbelief and wonder.

How? How had Uswa gone from trembling in shadows to this bold defiance? It didn’t make sense. But alongside her shock, something stirred in Risha’s chest... a fragile, secret relief. For the first time in she heard Uswa sounded alive after a very long time.

Aaba’s hand appeared from the sitting room doorway, keys dangling on a ring. He didn’t argue, didn’t question. Uswa snatched them, the metallic jingle clattering through the tense silence, and without another word, she marched toward the door.

The slam echoed through the house as she stepped outside. The sound lingered like a crack in glass.

Risha let out a shaky breath and turned to the others. Her voice dropped low, urgent. “We need to talk to Irfan. I’ve got a plan.”

Aama frowned. “Plan? What plan?”

Risha’s eyes didn’t leave the door. Her tone was steady, though a flicker of hope gleamed beneath it. “If he really did something wrong, then confronting him isn’t just about answers. It might... it might bring her back completely. If Uswa stands up to him, maybe the old Uswa... the one we lost... will return.”

For a moment, no one spoke. The hall was filled only with the hum of the fan and the faint echo of car tires crunching gravel outside.

Aama’s lips pressed into a thin line, worry written deep in her features. Huriya clutched the end of her scarf, eyes darting between them all. But Risha’s words hung there, undeniable, like a thread of possibility woven into the air.

Somewhere beyond their walls, Uswa was already on her way... keys in hand, fire in her chest, toward Irfan Kaleem.

And none of them knew whether she was walking toward healing... or disaster.

The silence in the hallway pressed down like a weight. Aama’s worried sigh seemed to echo off the walls. Huriya shifted uncomfortably, twisting the edge of her dupatta in her fingers.

“Do we follow her?” Huriya finally asked, her voice soft but trembling.

Risha’s eyes stayed fixed on the closed door, the faint sound of the car starting outside sending a chill down her spine. She shook her head slowly.
“No...” she said firmly. “I will call him.”

Before Aama or Huriya could question her, Risha had already pulled out her phone. Her hands trembled, but her resolve was steady. She scrolled quickly, found his number, and pressed call.

The line rang once. Twice. Then a click.

“Hello.” came the voice on the other end, rough with suspicion.

Risha didn’t waste a second. “Hey! Irfan... listen.” Her tone was urgent, low, and deliberate. “Uswa is coming to your house. No need to tell her anything. Just... just say it was a treatment. None of this is true. Say *Risha told me to do it.* I will handle the rest.”

There was a pause on the line, and then Irfan’s confused voice: “Treatment? What are you...”

“Please!” Risha cut him off sharply. “I don’t have time to explain. Just do what I say. If you fight her, if you argue, you’ll break her. But if you go along... it might fix her. It might give her a way back to herself.”

Irfan went silent, and she could hear the faint static of his breath through the receiver.

Before ending the call, Risha’s voice softened, pleading now:
“Please, Irfan... do not get angry. Even if she slaps you, even if she screams. Just believe me. Someone tried to destroy her life. And right now, you... you have a chance to save her.”

The line held for a heartbeat, then Irfan’s quiet agreement came:
“...Okay.”

Risha closed her eyes, exhaling the breath she had been holding, and hung up.

Behind her, Aama whispered, “Ya Allah, guide them both.”

And somewhere down the road, Uswa drove straight into the storm they had just set in motion.
