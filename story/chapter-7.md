Title: "Chapter 7 - The Writer’s Exit"
---

The living room had gone strangely quiet after the chaos of Uswa’s trembling return. Aama sat across from Irfan, still processing the look she had seen in her daughter’s eyes—terror so raw it felt contagious.

Irfan rose, brushing the dust from his sleeves, his voice low but firm.
“Ma’am, I have to go. But I suggest you keep an eye on her. She was so scared. You should go to the police.”

Aama’s heart skipped. She understood exactly what he meant... he believed the danger wasn’t imagined, that it had weight, shape, and footsteps in the night. She opened her mouth to speak, to beg him to stay a little longer, but before she could say a word, he was gone. The door clicked softly behind him, yet the absence echoed louder than his presence.

Uswa slipped past her mother in silence, her scarf half-unraveled, her face drained of expression. Without a word, she went straight into the bedroom and collapsed onto the bed. The exhaustion in her movements was heavier than sleep itself... it was surrender.

Huriya, standing by the window, watched the streetlamp shadows trembling across the road. Her brow furrowed as her thoughts spilled out aloud.
“How did she end up with *him*... my favorite writer of all people?” She hugged her arms close, as if hugging her own confusion. “I wish he’d stayed. I have so many questions I wanted to ask him.”

Her words weren’t accusing, but curious and tinged with a mix of admiration and disbelief. Irfan, the name printed on the covers of her books, the figure she had only known in her imagination, had walked into their house, spoken to her family, and left like a phantom.

Aama turned her gaze toward her youngest daughter. Uswa had curled onto her side, her fists clenched around the bedsheet, breath slowing into restless slumber. Aama’s chest tightened. She smoothed a hand gently over Uswa’s hair, brushing the strands away from her damp forehead.

“Let her sleep,” Aama whispered, more to herself than to anyone else. She knew her daughter’s nightmares had only just begun.

Behind her, Huriya remained in the doorway, silent now, her eyes still fixed on the empty space Irfan had left behind.

The night pressed close around the house, thick and watchful.
