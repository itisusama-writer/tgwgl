Title: "Chapter 2 - The Song in Smoke"
---

The next morning the Rizvi household buzzed with its familiar rhythm, clatter of dishes in the kitchen, the hum of the ceiling fan, the gossip of neighboring houses slipping in through open windows. But for Uswa, the world still felt muffled, as if she were wrapped in gauze. She had barely touched her breakfast, her fingers idly circling the rim of her teacup.

Aama clucked her tongue, wiping her hands on her dupatta. “This girl will waste away in this house if she keeps sitting like this.” She turned to the two cousins Safiya and Mahjabeen who had arrived that morning, bright and bustling, eager to visit. “Take her out somewhere. A change of air. Maybe the club, or the bazaar. Anywhere. She has to learn to live again.”

Uswa’s eyes flickered, sharp with resistance. “No, Aama. I don’t feel like it.”

Safiya leaned closer, her voice warm but insistent. “Api, it will be good for you. Just for a while. We’ll sit, talk, maybe listen to music. You can’t keep hiding at home.”

Mahjabeen added with a teasing smile, “We won’t even let you sulk. Promise.”

Uswa shook her head. Her lips pressed into a thin line, but under Aama’s stern gaze and her cousin's persistence, she finally gave in. With a resigned sigh, she stood, wrapping her shawl around her shoulders.

By nightfall, they entered Mehrabad’s only upscale club the same one where Irfan Kaleem nursed his whiskey and Samira Ghazal circled like a hawk. The neon glow painted the smoke-heavy air in restless colors. Waiters weaved through the crowd with trays of half-empty glasses.

Safiya and Mahjabeen led the way, chatting about old school friends and family gossip, trying to keep Uswa distracted. They didn’t notice the man slouched at the corner table, his tie undone, his words tumbling too freely to the woman opposite him. But Uswa did. For a fleeting second her eyes rested on the pair Samira leaning forward with a predator’s smile, Irfan muttering into his glass, but the moment passed, swallowed by noise and movement.

“Come, sit here,” Mahjabeen said, pointing to a small table near the stage.

On stage, a young guitarist adjusted the strap of his instrument. His name, the host had announced earlier, was Asad. He began to strum, his voice low and sure, weaving into the air.

The first few notes hit Uswa like a blow.

It was *that song*. The one Harim used to play for her every Thursday evening, no matter how busy the week had been. The ritual that belonged only to them, her husband’s hands on the strings, his voice carrying the words like a vow.

Her breath caught.

The club faded. The laughter, the clink of glasses, her cousin's chatter it all dissolved. She was no longer sitting on a chair in a crowded room. She was back in the living room of their small flat, Harim sitting cross-legged with his guitar, smiling at her as though nothing in the world existed but her.

Safiya nudged her gently. “Api, you okay? It’s a nice song, isn’t it?”

Uswa didn’t answer. Her eyes glazed, lips parting in a whisper no one else heard.

Then the memory shifted.

The song bled into another night. A darker one. Gunshots tearing through the street. Harim clutching his chest, blood soaking his shirt. The man behind him... just a shadow, a figure with a weapon, the same faceless nightmare that haunted her.

Her body jerked. Her throat tightened. She clutched the edge of the table until her knuckles turned white. Panic surged like fire in her veins.

“Api!” Safiya exclaimed, alarmed, reaching for her hand.

Mahjabeen stood quickly, waving for water. “What’s happening? Uswa, breathe! Just breathe!”

But Uswa was gone, lost in the spiral of memory, her breaths shallow, eyes wide with terror. The music, the club, everything blurred into the image of her husband collapsing.

It took both cousins to steady her, whispering frantic reassurances, trying to ground her back in the present. Faces from other tables turned curiously, but they ignored the stares.

“We need to get her out of here,” Mahjabeen muttered.

They half-carried her toward the exit, Safiya’s arm tight around her shoulders. Uswa’s chest heaved, the panic clawing at her even as the cool night air met them outside.

Behind them, the song continued. Inside, the club carried on patrons laughing, Irfan’s slurred confession slipping into Samira’s phone recorder unaware that, at another table, someone else’s life had cracked open again.
