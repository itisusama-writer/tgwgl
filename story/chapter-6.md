Title: "Chapter 6 - The Waiting Hour"
---

The night air at Gulraiz Hill Station had grown sharp, the mist rolling down from the pine slopes like an endless tide. Lamps flickered along the cobbled paths, but to Aama every shadow looked like it could be hiding her daughter.

“Where could she have gone?” Aama whispered, clutching her shawl tightly around her shoulders as they entered the hotel lobby. The blue emblem of the **The Blue Pines Hotel** glowed faintly above the reception desk, mocking her with its calmness while her heart raced.

Huriya hurried to the counter, her voice quivering but urgent.
“Excuse me, did you see my sister? Fair skin, black hair, pale face... she must have come through.”

The receptionist, half-asleep and disinterested, shook his head. “No one like that tonight.”

Aama sighed, leaning against the desk. “She couldn’t have gone far. She doesn’t even like being alone outside.” Her words carried both worry and disbelief, as though she couldn’t imagine Uswa stepping into the dark on her own.

Mr. Rizvi came in moments later, his face lined with strain. “She’s not around the bazaar either. The shops are shutting down. It’s not safe.”

Silence hung heavy. Then Aama straightened. “We’ll search. You and I,” she told Rizvi. “If she comes back here, she must not find an empty room. Huriya will stay.”

Huriya looked at her mother, torn between fear and resolve. “But Aama...”

“No,” Aama cut her off gently. “She trusts you the most. If she returns, you must be here.”

Huriya swallowed and nodded, though her hands trembled. She sat down in the lobby lounge, her eyes fixed on the glass door. Every time it creaked open, her breath caught, but it was always strangers, a porter, a tired couple, a delivery boy. The waiting gnawed at her, minute after minute. Later she went to the room.

Up in the hills, the mist thickened. Aama and Rizvi’s voices faded as they disappeared down the stone path, their lanterns bobbing faintly like lost fireflies.

Back at the hotel, Huriya pressed her hands together, whispering prayers under her breath. *Ya Allah, bring her back safe...* She thought of her sister’s distant eyes on the car ride earlier, staring out the window as though trapped in another world. She had felt it too ofte. Uswa drifting somewhere unreachable.

Huriya sat by the window of the small Blue Pines Hotel room, her knees pulled close, phone clutched in her hand. She had promised Aama she would wait here, but the waiting was torture. Every sound in the hallway made her heart leap, every creak of the wooden floorboards a cruel trick.

*Where are you, Uswa?*

Her thoughts kept circling back to her sister’s pale face in the car, her vacant eyes staring out at the hills. Huriya had tried to reach her, to joke, to comfort, but Uswa had been somewhere else... somewhere unreachable. Now she was gone completely, swallowed by the night mist.

She wiped at her eyes and checked her phone again. No call. No message. Nothing.

Then, a soft knock at the door.

Huriya’s chest tightened. She rose slowly, afraid to hope. Her hand trembled on the knob as she pulled it open.

And there... framed by the dim hallway light, stood **Uswa.**

Her hair clung damply to her temples, her face pale, her body sagging as though she had been carried by sheer willpower.

“Uswa?” Huriya’s voice cracked, the word breaking halfway.

Her sister stumbled forward, collapsing against her shoulder with a sob. The relief hit so hard Huriya nearly buckled under the weight. She held Uswa tightly, feeling the shivers running through her body, afraid that if she let go, she would lose her again.

But then, another presence.

Huriya lifted her head, her tear-stung eyes locking onto the man who stood beside Uswa. For a heartbeat, her mind refused to believe it. She knew that face. She had stared at it on book covers, memorized every word of his stories, whispered his sentences like prayers in the quiet of her room.

Her lips parted in disbelief.
“Oh my God… you’re Irfan Kaleem. The writer.”

The words tumbled out before she could stop them. She tightened her grip on Uswa, then stepped aside in a rush. “Please—please come inside. Aama and Abba are out looking for her. They’ll be back soon.”

Irfan inclined his head, his gaze steady but gentle as he looked at the trembling girl still clinging to him. “You can leave my hand now,” he said softly. “You’re safe here.”

But Uswa would not let go. She pressed her forehead deeper into Huriya’s shoulder, clutching both of them as if reality itself would dissolve without their touch.

Huriya’s throat tightened as she guided them inside, her hand fumbling for her phone. She had to call her parents, let them know.

The door rattled behind her.

She froze, phone still in hand, as it swung open.

Aama and Mr. Rizvi stood in the doorway, faces drawn with exhaustion from the long search. For a moment, their eyes didn’t register Irfan at all. They saw only their daughter.

“Uswa…” Aama whispered, her hands flying to her mouth.

And Huriya felt Uswa stir against her, lifting her head slowly, still trembling.

The room seemed to stop breathing. Relief, disbelief, and a strange, impossible truth hung in the air: her sister had returned alive, safe and with her stood the most unlikely man in Gulraiz.
