Title: "Chapter 11 – Coffee and Confessions"
---

The evening air was cool, carrying the faint hum of traffic and the scent of dust after a long, dry day. Huriya drove steadily, her hands loose on the steering wheel, when Irfan leaned back in his seat and broke the silence and was on their way back.

“Let’s stop at that café,” he said suddenly, nodding toward a small roadside café with warm light spilling through its windows.

Huriya gave him a sideways glance, half a smile tugging at her lips. “Coffee at this hour?”

“Trust me,” he replied, “we both need it.”

She pulled the car over, and they stepped inside. The café was quiet, almost drowsy, with only a few students scribbling in notebooks. The clatter of cups and the hiss of the coffee machine filled the room, wrapping them in a cocoon of warmth and silence.

Inside, the café was quiet, only a few students hunched over notebooks. They chose a corner table near the window. The clatter of cups and the hiss of the coffee machine filled the silence between them until Irfan finally leaned forward, elbows on the table.

“When I first saw Uswa,” he began, voice low, “I was... curious. There was something about her fear that didn’t make sense. Not just a girl running from shadows. Something heavier.”

Huriya studied him carefully. “Curious? Or obsessed?”

He half-smiled. “Maybe both.” He stirred the foam in his cup. “But I didn’t jump into writing her story blindly. I called Risha. He told me Harim’s killer was already in jail. That detail... among other things, gave me a hook. I thought, *what if the story wasn’t about Harim, or Uswa, but about the idea of fear itself?* That’s when the novel began to take shape.”

“But you used their names,” Huriya said.

“No,” Irfan shook his head. “I didn’t. Not once. I made sure. The names, the settings... I changed them all. It wasn’t Uswa. It wasn’t Harim. It was fiction.” He hesitated, then let out a tired breath. “At least I thought so.”

Huriya’s voice grew tight. “I was the one who showed her... I read your novel, Irfan. I told Uswa what was written in it. The way you twisted Harim’s death, the ugly details... it was impossible for her to control herself.”

“That’s the part I can’t explain.” He rubbed his temple. “The day I finished the draft, I woke up in the evening and I went out for a walk. Needed to clear my head. By the time I was heading back to the lodge, my phone rang... it was Zameer, my agent. He said I already sent him the manuscript.”

Her eyes widened. “But you hadn’t sent it.”

“Exactly. I wanted to reread it first. Maybe even talk to Uswa before making a decision. But somehow... it was already in his inbox.” He paused, staring out the glass window.

Huriya remembered Uswa’s trembling voice, the way she had snapped at her earlier. She looked down, suddenly guilty.

“She clung to me like I was her last chance,” Irfan continued. “And for a moment, I thought maybe this was more than just a story. Maybe... someone wanted it to become real.”

They sat in silence, the hum of the café pressing around them.

Huriya broke it. “You think someone leaked it on purpose? Maybe to trap her?”

“Or me.” His lips tightened. “I don’t know who, or why. But it wasn’t an accident.”

The waitress dropped off their bill, and they both rose. Outside, gets colder than before. The drive back was quiet until they reached Irfan’s neighborhood.

He turned to her as she parked. “Huriya.” His voice was gentler now. “You have an eye for detail. You don’t hesitate to challenge me. That’s rare.”

She blinked. “What are you trying to say?”

“I want you to be my editor.” His lips curved slightly. “Help me make sense of this mess.”

For a moment, she said nothing. Inside, her chest tightened with a strange warmth... half pride, half fear. She had always admired his work, dreamed of being part of something bigger than just reading it. But her face remained calm.

“I’ll... think about it,” she said lightly, as if brushing off the weight of the offer.

He smiled knowingly. “Fair enough.”

As he stepped out of the car, Huriya watched him walk toward his door. A flicker of excitement sparked in her chest despite herself. She knew she would not be able to say no.

And yet, something gnawed at her... if the novel was already in Zameer’s hands without Irfan sending it... who else was pulling the strings?

The night felt heavy again, as though the story had already moved ahead of all of them.
