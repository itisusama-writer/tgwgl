Title: "Chapter 5 - The Hill Station"
---

The drive wound upward into Gulraiz hill station, the car climbing through narrow bends where the air grew thinner and cooler. Mist rolled over the valley, slipping between the tall pines like restless smoke. Uswa sat pressed against the window, her eyes distant, tracing every shadow as though the mountains themselves were watching her.

Mr. Rizvi kept his hands steady on the steering wheel, the same firm calmness he had always carried. Aama and Huriya exchanged glances from the back seat, whispering occasionally to break the heavy silence. But Uswa said nothing. The journey had emptied her words, leaving only the tension in her shoulders and the unease flickering in her eyes.

By the time they reached the hill station, night had begun to push its way across the sky. Their car pulled up before a modest but welcoming hotel, its outer wall marked by a large painted emblem **The Blue Pines Hotel**. The logo, a pine tree brushed in cobalt, seemed to glow faintly in the mist.

Inside, the lobby smelled faintly of wood polish and damp earth. The family took adjoining rooms on the second floor. After settling their luggage, they ate a light meal in the small dining hall: lentil soup, warm bread, and steaming tea. Aama reminded them all to rest first, and for a few hours, the four of them drifted into uneasy sleep.

When they woke, it was past seven. The mountain air seeped in through the open window, cold and sharp. After another cup of tea, Aama suggested a short walk. Mr. Rizvi decided to remain at the hotel, tired from the drive, while Uswa, Huriya, and Aama wrapped themselves in shawls and stepped outside.

The roads were quiet, hushed by the hour. The streetlamps threw long cones of light over the cobbled path, while far below the valley glimmered faintly with scattered fires from the local villages. They walked slowly, close together, breathing in the pine-scented night.

Then, at exactly 8 o’clock, the glow changed. A sudden flare of orange rose against the dark from somewhere near the ridge. A fire.

The three of them stopped, watching as tongues of flame licked upward near an isolated lodge that sat farther down the slope. Sparks cracked into the night, and a plume of smoke climbed high, curling into the mist.

“What is that?” Huriya whispered, clutching Uswa’s arm.

“A lodge,” Aama murmured, her face pale in the firelight. “Someone must have left their hearth unattended...” But even as she said it, her voice wavered. The fire didn’t look like an accident... it was alive, growing, spreading against the dark like something that wanted to be seen.

Uswa stood transfixed. Her heart pounded so loudly it drowned the crackle of the flames. For a moment, she thought she saw movement along the ridge, something darker than the smoke, slipping between the trees.

Her breath caught. Her eyes darted, trying to follow it. The mist shifted, and the shape seemed to come closer, dragging with it the old terror that had never truly left her.

“Huriya... Aama...” she whispered, her voice breaking. “He’s here.”

Both women stiffened. “Who?” Huriya asked, frightened, but before the words left her mouth, Uswa pulled away.

She turned and ran. Down the path, past the curve of the road, her shawl fluttering like a torn wing. The forest seemed to swallow her as the fire’s glow deepened behind.

“Uswa!” Aama cried out, panic slicing through her voice. She grabbed Huriya’s hand, clutching it tightly. “Come back!”

But Uswa was already gone, the mist closing in around her.

Aama and Huriya stood trembling, the fire reflecting in their eyes, both rooted to the spot. They could still hear her footsteps pounding away into the dark until even that faded into silence.

And there, at the edge of the ridge, the two women realized they were alone.
