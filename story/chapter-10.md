Title: "Chapter 10 – The Knock at Midnight"
---

The headlights of the car cut through the silent street, throwing long shadows across the rows of shuttered houses. Uswa’s grip on the steering wheel was so tight her knuckles turned pale. Her chest heaved, fury boiling over into trembling exhaustion. She pressed the brakes hard, the car screeched, and she stopped right in front of Irfan’s house.

Without a second thought, she stumbled out, her dupatta trailing behind her. She stormed up the small staircase and began pounding on the wooden door with her fists.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Inside, Irfan had just set his phone aside, mind heavy but steady with the instructions Risha had given him. The pounding startled him. He opened the door slowly, only to be met with Uswa’s burning, tear-filled eyes.

“Oh...” she spat, her voice sharp with disbelief. “Mr. Irfan. The lodge guy.”

Before he could even respond, her voice broke into a shout:

“I thought you were not like other guys!” she screamed, words tumbling out between ragged breaths. “How the hell did you lie about me and Harim?”

Irfan tried to step back, keeping his face as calm as possible. “Uswa, please. It was...”

“Don’t you dare say my name!” she cut him off. “You played with my pain! You... you wrote it down like some kind of cheap story. Did you think I wouldn’t find out?”

Her hands shook as she jabbed a finger at him. “I trusted you for one moment. One! And you made me a spectacle.”

Irfan swallowed, forcing himself to remember Risha’s words: *Don’t argue. Say it was for a treatment. Just let her blame you. I’ll handle the rest.*

So he stood still, silent, taking the blows of her words like stones hurled at him.

“You disgust me!” she shouted, her voice cracking. “I thought you were different... better than the rest. But you’re a liar. A selfish, shameless liar!”

She raised her hand to slap him... but it faltered halfway. Her body swayed, knees buckling. Exhaustion drained her strength. Before she could collapse against the doorframe, Irfan caught her.

“Uswa!” His voice shook. He lowered her gently to the ground, panic flooding through him. Her eyelids fluttered closed.

Heart racing, he fumbled for his phone and dialed Risha. She picked up instantly.

“She fainted,” he blurted out, his voice desperate. “I promise I did nothing. What do I do now?”

On the other side, Risha’s tone was firm but calm. “I believe you. Listen to me carefully, Irfan. I’m sending you the location. Bring her back safely. Right now.”

The call ended. A map notification buzzed onto his screen.

Irfan looked at the unconscious girl in his arms, the weight of the night pressing on him heavier than ever. He took a deep breath, then gathered her gently, stepping out into the still, silent street.

The story was only tightening around him.

Irfan struggled to steady his breath as he carried Uswa’s limp figure toward her car. The keys had fallen from her hand earlier; he found them on the seat and slid into the driver’s side, adjusting her carefully beside him.

“Wow,” he muttered under his breath as he ran his hands over the steering wheel. “Tiny and cute.”

The engine roared to life, and he drove through the quiet streets, every passing light making his nerves tighten. By the time he stopped in front of Uswa’s house, his shirt was damp with sweat.

He stepped out, scooped her back into his arms, and knocked firmly on the wooden door.

The door opened almost immediately. Risha stood there, her eyes scanning the scene without surprise. She gestured quickly. “Bring her in.”

Inside, the air was heavy but calm. Irfan carried Uswa up to the lounge where Risha and Huriya were waiting. They gently took her from him and guided her upstairs, into her room.

He lingered behind, silent, heart pounding, until the door clicked shut.

Half an hour later, the muffled sound of shifting sheets stirred the quiet house. Uswa’s voice broke through, raw and furious:

“Where is that asshole!”

Irfan, who had been leaning against the doorframe of her room, stiffened. Just a few feet away stood Aama, watching her daughter with quiet, worried eyes. Irfan took a slow step forward and said softly, “I am here.”

Before his voice had even faded, Risha shot him a sharp glance. “Just keep your mouth shut,” she murmured under her breath, warning him.

Uswa’s eyes blazed. She tried to push herself off the bed, staggering as though her rage alone fueled her body. But before she could launch at him, Huriya and Risha steadied her, holding her gently but firmly.

“Calm down, sweetie,” Risha soothed, her tone deliberately low and steady. “It was a treatment. I told him to write that. Look...” She gestured around, nodding reassuringly. “You are good now.”

Uswa’s breath came in gasps, her anger colliding with confusion. Risha leaned closer, her eyes steady.

“Tell me,” she asked softly. “Do you see that man who was trying to kill you?”

The question caught Uswa off guard. For a moment, her face went blank, searching. Then she let out a sharp breath, almost a laugh.

“Naa... He was in jail, I know. How can he kill me?”

Relief rippled across the room. Huriya turned to glance at Aama, her eyes shining with a small, cautious hope. Aama’s expression softened, lips trembling with the hint of a smile.

“See?” Risha said gently, squeezing Uswa’s hand. “It was what we all decided... to push you back to normal.”

Huriya, Aama, and even the hesitant Irfan echoed together, voices overlapping:

“Yaa.”

The room fell into a strange hush... one that felt like victory, but also something darker, as if the treatment had worked a little too perfectly.

The room behind them settled into silence, broken only by Uswa’s uneven breathing. Risha closed the door gently, her hand resting on the knob for a moment before she turned to Irfan.

He exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “Now I have to take the rickshaw or a cab,” he muttered, almost to himself.

Before Risha could reply, a voice cut in from the hallway.
“I’ll drop you,” Huriya said, stepping forward with a small, steady smile. “I know how to drive.”

Irfan glanced at her, surprised but relieved. “That’s good.”

They started down the stairs together, the wooden steps creaking softly under their weight. But Huriya’s tone shifted as soon as they reached the lounge.

“But this...” she said, her brow furrowed, eyes narrowing on Irfan. “This wasn’t a treatment. I’ve read all of your novels. This doesn’t look like your style at all. Why did you do that?”

Risha drew in a breath, her lips parting. “I’ll tell you the real story—”

But Irfan cut her off sharply, raising his hand slightly. “No.” He locked eyes with Huriya, his voice low but firm. “Come drop me. We’ll have a coffee, and I’ll tell you the whole thing there.”

For a beat, the air hung heavy between them. Then Huriya gave a short nod. “Okay... let’s go.”

The front door creaked open, the cool night air sweeping in. Irfan followed her outside, leaving Risha standing in the dim light of the hallway, watching them both disappear into the night.
