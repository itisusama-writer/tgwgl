Title: "Chapter 12 – A New Morning"
---

The smell of fried parathas and simmering tea drifted across the small dining room. Sunlight filtered in through the lace curtains, scattering golden patterns on the table where Aama had carefully set out the breakfast. The clink of plates and the soft whistle of the kettle created a rare calm in the house, a calm they hadn’t felt in weeks.

Uswa sat down slowly, her fingers brushing against the edge of her dupatta. For a moment she just stared at her reflection in the polished steel jug placed before her. Her cheeks looked hollow, her collarbones sharp. She pressed her lips together, then whispered as if to herself, though the words carried across the table:

“Aama… I’m looking so thin. It’s like I haven’t eaten anything for weeks.”

Her voice wavered, half in surprise, half in quiet shame.

Aama’s eyes softened. She put down the spoon in her hand and leaned closer, her wrinkled palm resting gently on Uswa’s arm.
“Oh, my beta. Don’t say that. Now you eat as much as you want and you will get better. You got a new life after so long. Now you will live as you wish.”

Uswa lowered her gaze, feeling the warmth of her mother’s touch seep into her skin. It was comforting, but it also carried a weight... the reminder that she had been to a place darker than anyone had deserved.

Across the table, Huriya blew on her tea before taking a sip, her eyes mischievous as ever.
“You know,” she said, tilting her head, “it’s now looking weird to see you back normal. I have to adjust with this Apa’s new version. Lucky me... now I don’t have to pretend like an older sister anymore.”

Uswa rolled her eyes, a small smirk tugging at her lips despite herself.
“Oh... just shut up.”

The playful jab felt strangely refreshing, like the ghost of her old self had stepped back into the room. For a beat, silence hung between them, only broken by the hum of the ceiling fan. Then, as if a switch flipped inside her, Uswa’s eyes lit up with a sudden thought. She turned to her sister.

“Hey, Huri...”

The nickname slipped out naturally, the way it used to in their childhood, before all the shadows, before all the secrets.

Huriya froze for a heartbeat, her spoon halfway to her mouth. She hadn’t heard *that* in so long. Slowly, her lips curved into a grin she couldn’t quite hide. “You haven’t called me that in years...” she murmured, almost to herself, but her eyes glowed with relief.

Uswa chuckled softly. “Let’s go out somewhere this evening. We would have fun. Just like before.”

Huriya leaned back in her chair, nodding eagerly. “Deal. Finally, Apa is back.”

Aama watched them quietly, her hands folded on the table. She didn’t interrupt, but her heart swelled at the sight, her daughters, laughing together again. Yet behind her smile, a faint shadow lingered in her eyes. She knew healing didn’t happen overnight. Ghosts had long fingers, and sometimes they reached back even when you thought you had escaped them.

She cleared her throat gently.
“Beta...” she said, her voice soft but firm. “Be careful, hmm? The world outside... it doesn’t forget so easily. And Huriya, if your Apa feels weak, if she has any panic attacks, you take care of her. Don’t let her go through it alone.”

Huriya nodded, a seriousness settling into her eyes for once. But then she exhaled sharply and leaned back in her chair.
“Aama... not again. She’s back now. Don’t make me feel like I’m still the older sister of Apa. I’m fed up of carrying that role.”

Aama gave her a look, half stern, half pleading, but before she could respond, Uswa reached across the table, placing her hand over Aama’s.
“Aama... everything will be fine. I promise. I hate that old version of me... the scared one who kept hiding, who kept breaking. I’m not going back to her. Not anymore.”

For a moment, silence wrapped around them again, heavier this time, but steadier too. Aama pressed her daughter’s hand and whispered a prayer under her breath.

And then she let them laugh again, let them dream about the evening ahead, as the sun climbed higher and the day stretched open with promise.

By the time evening fell, the house was buzzing with small preparations. Huriya rummaged through her wardrobe, tossing aside kurtas and shawls, muttering under her breath about what to wear. Uswa, standing in front of the mirror, tried on a pair of earrings that had been tucked away for months. Her reflection still startled her sometimes... the thinner face, the pale skin, but tonight she decided not to linger on those details.

She dusted her cheeks with a hint of color and smiled faintly at herself. *No more shadows,* she thought. *Tonight I live.*

Huriya peeked in, adjusting her scarf around her shoulders.
“Wow, Apa. Look at you. You’re actually glowing. Careful... you might attract unwanted attention.”

Uswa smirked. “Good. Maybe I want attention tonight.”

They both laughed, the sound echoing through the hallway. Aama, from the sitting room, looked up as the two sisters appeared ready to leave. She frowned slightly, worry lines creasing her forehead.

“Beta, don’t stay out too late. And if you feel uneasy...”

“Aama!” Huriya groaned, grabbing her clutch. “Don’t worry. I’ve got Apa. And she’s the one dragging me out this time, not the other way around.”

Uswa leaned down to kiss Aama’s forehead. “We’ll be fine. Promise.”

The drive was filled with chatter and bursts of laughter. The city outside glittered with neon lights, tea stalls, and streams of traffic. Music thumped faintly from passing cars. Huriya rolled down the window, letting the night air rush in. For the first time in weeks, it felt like the weight had lifted from Uswa’s chest.

“Remember,” Huriya said as she steered through the traffic, “this is the *same club* you went to with cousins. Are you sure you want to go back there? Old memories and all?”

Uswa hesitated only for a second before replying. “That’s exactly why I want to go. To rewrite those memories. To prove to myself that I’m not her anymore.”

The words hung between them, firm and unshaken.

Finally, the car slowed, pulling into the brightly lit parking lot of the club. The building stood alive, its glass façade reflecting streaks of colored light, laughter spilling faintly from inside. People in groups walked past them, heels clicking, perfumes lingering in the air.

Uswa exhaled, her hand brushing against the car door handle. Huriya glanced at her, searching her face.
“Ready?”

Uswa gave a small, determined nod. “More than ever.”

Together, they stepped out into the night, the entrance of the club looming ahead, bright, loud, and full of promises yet to unfold.
