Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The Rizvi house in Mehrabad always smelled faintly of old paper and cardamom tea. Its tall windows let in the autumn air, but inside the rooms were thick with silence, a silence so heavy that even the ticking wall clock seemed afraid to be heard.

In the drawing room, Huriya sat cross-legged on the rug, a half-ruined book in her lap. The spine was bent back, the last fifty pages torn clean out. She smoothed a palm over the wrinkled cover as though that could undo the damage.

“Aama!” she called, her tone sharp with both anger and sorrow. “She’s done it again. She tore my book apart. Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this? Irfan Kaleem doesn’t even reprint so quickly.”

From the kitchen came the clatter of utensils and the smell of onions frying in ghee. Aama shuffled out, her dupatta pinned loosely at the shoulder, wiping her hands on the edge of her shawl. Her face carried the softness of someone too tired to argue anymore.

“Leave her, Huriya,” Aama said, lowering herself onto the wooden chair by the window. “You know your sister. You know the storm she is carrying. A book is nothing in comparison.”

Huriya frowned and hugged the torn novel against her chest. “But Aama, this isn’t normal. She doesn’t eat, she doesn’t talk. She stares at walls for hours. And when I try to sit with her, she... she just pushes me away.”

“You are young,” Aama said gently. “You think pain can be argued out of someone, like convincing a stubborn child. But grief…” She shook her head. “Grief has no logic. Let her be.”

The floorboards creaked upstairs. Both women looked up. A faint scraping noise followed the sound of a latch opening. Moments later, Uswa appeared at the top of the staircase.

Her eyes were sunken, ringed with sleepless shadows. She wore the same pale kurta from yesterday, creases running down its length, and her hair hung loose, uncombed. She didn’t acknowledge her sister or her mother. She simply walked down, one step at a time, as if the stairs themselves were a burden, and drifted toward the veranda.

Huriya’s lips trembled between anger and pity. She whispered, almost to herself, “She’s not even here anymore.”

Aama rose slowly, her joints stiff, and followed her elder daughter. On the veranda, the evening breeze stirred the neem branches, scattering leaves across the courtyard. Uswa stood at the railing, clutching her shawl around her shoulders though the air was mild.

Aama laid a hand on her back. For a while, she said nothing. The silence stretched, filled only by the rustling leaves. Finally, her voice came low, almost breaking:
“Harim is gone.”

Uswa stiffened. Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came. Her eyes flickered toward the neem tree, its leaves trembling against the sky. She held her breath as if even air might betray her.

Aama drew her close, rocking her gently like she had done when Uswa was a child with fevers. “Beta, you must eat something. A sip of tea at least. The heart cannot live on sorrow alone. Otherwise it will consume you.”

But Uswa only leaned her head against her mother’s shoulder, blank and mute.

From the doorway, Huriya watched, arms still wrapped around her ruined book. She wanted to run forward, to shake her sister into speaking, into crying, into doing *something*. But she stayed rooted, her throat tight.

That night, the household retreated into uneasy quiet. Huriya stacked her novels back on the shelf, carefully placing the damaged one on top, as though arranging her grief in order. Aama sat in the sitting room with her prayer beads, her eyes on the stairway where shadows pooled.

Upstairs, Uswa’s door remained shut. No sound, no weeping, not even the creak of the bed. Just silence... unsettling and unbroken.

Aama pressed her beads harder, her fingers trembling. She knew silence wasn’t healing her daughter. It was swallowing her whole. And deep inside, she understood: if this went on, Uswa could not be left here, not even within the walls of Rizvi House.

Soon, she would have to take her elsewhere.
Somewhere beyond this suffocating quiet.
Toward Risha’s clinic.
