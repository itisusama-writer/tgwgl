Title: "Chapter 8 – Broken Reflections"
---

The return from Gulraiz Hill Station had been quiet, almost too quiet. The mountain air that once felt fresh and cleansing was already fading into memory as the family’s car rolled back into the familiar streets of Mehrabad. Aama seemed relieved to be home again, while Huriya carried the same restless energy as always. Uswa, however, had been wrapped in silence for days, her eyes following shadows more than people, her words barely escaping her lips.

A week passed. Life in Mehrabad began to slip back into its usual rhythm, the sound of the milkman’s bell in the morning, the neighborhood children shouting in the street, the calls of street vendors drifting through the air. Yet inside their house, there was a strange unease, like the walls were holding their breath.

Something had shifted outside their circle, and it was impossible to ignore.

Irfan’s new book had exploded into the market. Bookstores in the city kept his novel displayed front and center; reviews in newspapers praised him as “a daring storyteller with a fearless pen.” The whispers of readers spread faster than wildfire, and the name *Irfan Khan* seemed to be on everyone’s tongue.

Inside their home, however, the news felt less like triumph and more like betrayal.

Huriya was the first to bring it up.

“He is quite fast,” she said one afternoon, her voice laced with a sharpness that wasn’t just admiration. She was holding a paperback copy of Irfan’s book, its spine already creased from her restless flipping. She tapped the cover with her fingernail. “But...”

She paused, eyes flicking toward her sister.

Uswa sat in the corner, her scarf pulled tightly around her shoulders, head lowered as though she could shield herself from the world by shrinking into silence. The weak afternoon light came in through the half-drawn curtains, falling across her face in fractured stripes.

Huriya took a step closer, her expression tightening. “Apa. See. He wrote your story. He even wrote the names.”

The words cut through the silence like a sudden storm.

“I’ve read it,” Huriya continued, though her voice wavered. “He talks nasty about you and...” She hesitated, biting down on her lip before forcing the words out. “...and Harim bhai.”

For a heartbeat, everything froze. Even the ticking of the old wall clock seemed to vanish.

Uswa’s hand shot forward, snatching the book from Huriya’s grip. Her fingers tightened around it as though she could crush the pages into dust.

And then, like a dam bursting, something inside Uswa cracked.

Her eyes blazed, her shoulders trembled, and her voice rose, loud, sharp, alive. “How the hell would he do something like this!”

The shout startled even her. For weeks she had spoken in whispers, her words fragile as glass. Now they came out raw, jagged, undeniable.

Huriya tilted her head, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Oh wow, you can speak loud. Impressive.”

From across the room, Aama looked at her. She didn’t understand what had happened, but somewhere inside she felt a quiet happiness because at last, she had heard the true voice of her daughter.

Huriya's remark stung, but it didn’t matter. The silence Uswa had hidden behind was gone, shattered.

She stood suddenly, her scarf slipping from her shoulder, and began to pace the room. Her steps were restless, uneven. Her hands clenched and unclenched as if they were searching for something to hold onto.

“Harim...” she whispered under her breath, the name escaping before she could stop it.

For a moment, she was no longer in the dim little living room of Mehrabad. She was back in another time, in the memory of Harim’s laughter as he carried groceries through the door, the way he would tease her about her silence, the warmth of his hand brushing against hers when no one was looking. She remembered his eyes, gentle but steady, how they had always made her feel safe.

Her fingers flew over the pages, flipping faster, her eyes scanning the words. With each line her face grew tighter, her breathing harsher.

“What the hell is this?” she spat, slamming a page flat with her palm. “Lies... everywhere! He twists my life like some dirty game. And Harim...” her voice broke, rising again, “how dare he write about him like this?”

She turned another page, her hands trembling but fierce. “This isn’t his story to tell. Not mine. Not Harim’s. Damn him for thinking he owns it!”

Her scarf slipped off her shoulder as she stood, pacing, muttering curses half under her breath and half out loud. “Shameless man… using my pain… my love… like entertainment for strangers. Damn him!”

Huriya exchanged a glance with Aama. Neither spoke.

Aama’s face was unreadable at first, but behind her eyes there was something almost tender. She didn’t understand the details of the words Uswa was throwing, but she knew one thing: for the first time in so long, her daughter’s voice was alive—sharp, angry, and full.

And that, in its own way, felt like healing.

Here’s **Chapter 8.2** written in your style and notes — keeping it as a continuation from the previous heated scene but also giving it a natural flow.

“Calm down, beta,” Aama finally said, her voice gentle but firm, trying to pull Uswa back from the edge.

“No, Aama!” Uswa shot back, her chest heaving. Her grip on the book was so tight her knuckles whitened. “How could he say this bullshit about me and Harim?”

Huriya opened her mouth, almost carefully, as if she wanted to soften the blow. “Apa, maybe he...”

“Bla. Bla. Bla!” Uswa cut her off, her voice rising. She tossed the book onto the table with a thud. “He was just...” she stopped for a moment, her lips trembling, then spat, “Your favorite writer is an asshole.”

She turned, pacing two steps toward her room, her scarf trailing behind her. “I am going to do something about this Irfan. How could he...” Her voice broke into fragments, fury and disbelief tangled together.

Then, without another word, she stormed towards her room, the sound of her footsteps echoing into the silence.

For a moment, Aama and Huriya simply stared after her. And then, unexpectedly, both broke into laughter. Not cruel laughter, but a release, like something heavy had lifted. For in Uswa’s anger, in her raw, unfiltered words, they caught a glimpse of the old Uswa, the one they thought they had lost.
