Title: "Chapter 14 - Slice of Life"

The next morning, the breakfast table was unusually quiet. Aama had made parathas and fried eggs, the aroma filling the room, but Uswa sat hunched forward, her head bowed, her spoon dragging circles in her plate.

Huriya glanced at her and frowned. “Apa... you’re not eating?”

Uswa didn’t reply. Her lips moved faintly, as though whispering something under her breath, but the words were too low to catch.

Aama’s brows knitted in concern. She leaned forward, her voice soft but firm. “Uswa... beta, everything okay? Please tell me, are you alright?”

Uswa finally lifted her eyes, but they were vacant, her tone flat, almost eerie. “Sometimes... things don’t feel real. Sometimes... I don’t feel real.”

The air tightened instantly. Huriya’s spoon clattered onto the table. “Apa... what are you saying? You’re scaring me.”

Aama pushed her chair back and hurried to Uswa’s side, placing a trembling hand on her shoulder. “Uswa, listen to me... are you hurt? Did something happen? Please, beta, talk to me.”

Huriya half-stood, panic rising. “I’m calling Risha Baji...”

But just as she pulled her phone out, Uswa suddenly burst out laughing. Her eyes lit up, and she held her stomach like a child caught in mischief. “Oh my God! You should’ve seen your faces!”

Aama and Huriya stared at her in disbelief.

“It was a prank, Aama! I was just playing with you.” Uswa leaned in, wrapping her arms around her mother tightly. “Sorry. Don’t be mad.”

Aama was too shaken to speak at first. Her hand pressed against her chest as though calming her heartbeat. “Prank? You think this is funny, Uswa? Do you know what you just did? My heart nearly stopped.”

Huriya slammed her palm on the table. “Apa, this isn’t a joke! You’re not twelve anymore, stop acting like a kid.”

Uswa pulled back, still smiling nervously. “Okay, okay, I’m sorry! I just... I wanted to lighten the mood. Things have been so heavy lately.”

Aama shook her head, eyes glistening. “Beta, you don’t play with your mother’s heart like this. We worry because we love you.”

Uswa’s face softened, guilt finally flickering across her expression. She hugged Aama again, whispering, “I love you too. I won’t do it again.”

The rest of breakfast continued in silence, but the tension lingered like smoke that refused to clear.

By afternoon, the house had returned to its usual rhythm. Aama busied herself in the kitchen while Huriya scrolled on her phone in the lounge. Uswa, restless, decided to take a walk outside. She slipped on her sandals and strolled into the narrow street, the sunlight washing her face with warmth.

As she turned the corner, she spotted a familiar figure balancing a stack of files and folders against her chest. A bright smile broke on the girl’s face the moment she saw her.

“Uswa Api! Oh my God, it’s really you!” Hamna hurried over, nearly dropping her papers. She set them right and flung her arms around Uswa.

Uswa chuckled, hugging her back. “Hamna! You’ve grown so much. Last time I saw you, you were this tiny little kid running around with a juice box.”

Hamna giggled. “I was never that little... That was ages ago! You look awesome, Api. I mean it... like... movie-star awesome.”

Uswa raised an eyebrow, teasing. “Movie-star, huh? Careful, or I’ll start charging for autographs.”

Both burst into laughter, the street briefly echoing with their joy.

Uswa glanced at the files in Hamna’s arms. “And what’s all this? Where are you running off to with so much homework?”

Hamna adjusted her grip. “Oh, this? I’m going to Risha Api. I need some career advice. I’m confused, you know... should I be a psychologist like her, or maybe try something else in the medical field? And I need her opinion on hostels, which university to apply to... Mehrabad doesn’t even have a proper university, you know that.”

Uswa’s heart warmed at her determination. She cupped Hamna’s face and kissed her forehead gently. “Best of luck, Hamna. Whatever you choose, I know you’ll shine.”

Hamna’s cheeks flushed with pride. “Thanks, Api. That means a lot.”

They walked a little further together before parting ways, Hamna off to chase her future while Uswa lingered, a small smile tugging at her lips. For the first time that day, the heaviness in her chest seemed lighter.
