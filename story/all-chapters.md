Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The Rizvi house in Mehrabad always smelled faintly of old paper and cardamom tea. Its tall windows let in the autumn air, but inside the rooms were thick with silence, a silence so heavy that even the ticking wall clock seemed afraid to be heard.

In the drawing room, Huriya sat cross-legged on the rug, a half-ruined book in her lap. The spine was bent back, the last fifty pages torn clean out. She smoothed a palm over the wrinkled cover as though that could undo the damage.

“Aama!” she called, her tone sharp with both anger and sorrow. “She’s done it again. She tore my book apart. Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this? Irfan Kaleem doesn’t even reprint so quickly.”

From the kitchen came the clatter of utensils and the smell of onions frying in ghee. Aama shuffled out, her dupatta pinned loosely at the shoulder, wiping her hands on the edge of her shawl. Her face carried the softness of someone too tired to argue anymore.

“Leave her, Huriya,” Aama said, lowering herself onto the wooden chair by the window. “You know your sister. You know the storm she is carrying. A book is nothing in comparison.”

Huriya frowned and hugged the torn novel against her chest. “But Aama, this isn’t normal. She doesn’t eat, she doesn’t talk. She stares at walls for hours. And when I try to sit with her, she... she just pushes me away.”

“You are young,” Aama said gently. “You think pain can be argued out of someone, like convincing a stubborn child. But grief…” She shook her head. “Grief has no logic. Let her be.”

The floorboards creaked upstairs. Both women looked up. A faint scraping noise followed the sound of a latch opening. Moments later, Uswa appeared at the top of the staircase.

Her eyes were sunken, ringed with sleepless shadows. She wore the same pale kurta from yesterday, creases running down its length, and her hair hung loose, uncombed. She didn’t acknowledge her sister or her mother. She simply walked down, one step at a time, as if the stairs themselves were a burden, and drifted toward the veranda.

Huriya’s lips trembled between anger and pity. She whispered, almost to herself, “She’s not even here anymore.”

Aama rose slowly, her joints stiff, and followed her elder daughter. On the veranda, the evening breeze stirred the neem branches, scattering leaves across the courtyard. Uswa stood at the railing, clutching her shawl around her shoulders though the air was mild.

Aama laid a hand on her back. For a while, she said nothing. The silence stretched, filled only by the rustling leaves. Finally, her voice came low, almost breaking:
“Harim is gone.”

Uswa stiffened. Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came. Her eyes flickered toward the neem tree, its leaves trembling against the sky. She held her breath as if even air might betray her.

Aama drew her close, rocking her gently like she had done when Uswa was a child with fevers. “Beta, you must eat something. A sip of tea at least. The heart cannot live on sorrow alone. Otherwise it will consume you.”

But Uswa only leaned her head against her mother’s shoulder, blank and mute.

From the doorway, Huriya watched, arms still wrapped around her ruined book. She wanted to run forward, to shake her sister into speaking, into crying, into doing *something*. But she stayed rooted, her throat tight.

That night, the household retreated into uneasy quiet. Huriya stacked her novels back on the shelf, carefully placing the damaged one on top, as though arranging her grief in order. Aama sat in the sitting room with her prayer beads, her eyes on the stairway where shadows pooled.

Upstairs, Uswa’s door remained shut. No sound, no weeping, not even the creak of the bed. Just silence... unsettling and unbroken.

Aama pressed her beads harder, her fingers trembling. She knew silence wasn’t healing her daughter. It was swallowing her whole. And deep inside, she understood: if this went on, Uswa could not be left here, not even within the walls of Rizvi House.

Soon, she would have to take her elsewhere.
Somewhere beyond this suffocating quiet.
Toward Risha’s clinic.

Title: "Chapter 2 - The Song in Smoke"
---

The next morning the Rizvi household buzzed with its familiar rhythm, clatter of dishes in the kitchen, the hum of the ceiling fan, the gossip of neighboring houses slipping in through open windows. But for Uswa, the world still felt muffled, as if she were wrapped in gauze. She had barely touched her breakfast, her fingers idly circling the rim of her teacup.

Aama clucked her tongue, wiping her hands on her dupatta. “This girl will waste away in this house if she keeps sitting like this.” She turned to the two cousins Safiya and Mahjabeen who had arrived that morning, bright and bustling, eager to visit. “Take her out somewhere. A change of air. Maybe the club, or the bazaar. Anywhere. She has to learn to live again.”

Uswa’s eyes flickered, sharp with resistance. “No, Aama. I don’t feel like it.”

Safiya leaned closer, her voice warm but insistent. “Api, it will be good for you. Just for a while. We’ll sit, talk, maybe listen to music. You can’t keep hiding at home.”

Mahjabeen added with a teasing smile, “We won’t even let you sulk. Promise.”

Uswa shook her head. Her lips pressed into a thin line, but under Aama’s stern gaze and her cousin's persistence, she finally gave in. With a resigned sigh, she stood, wrapping her shawl around her shoulders.

---

By nightfall, they entered Mehrabad’s only upscale club the same one where Irfan Kaleem nursed his whiskey and Samira Ghazal circled like a hawk. The neon glow painted the smoke-heavy air in restless colors. Waiters weaved through the crowd with trays of half-empty glasses.

Safiya and Mahjabeen led the way, chatting about old school friends and family gossip, trying to keep Uswa distracted. They didn’t notice the man slouched at the corner table, his tie undone, his words tumbling too freely to the woman opposite him. But Uswa did. For a fleeting second her eyes rested on the pair Samira leaning forward with a predator’s smile, Irfan muttering into his glass, but the moment passed, swallowed by noise and movement.

“Come, sit here,” Mahjabeen said, pointing to a small table near the stage.

On stage, a young guitarist adjusted the strap of his instrument. His name, the host had announced earlier, was Asad. He began to strum, his voice low and sure, weaving into the air.

The first few notes hit Uswa like a blow.

It was *that song*. The one Harim used to play for her every Thursday evening, no matter how busy the week had been. The ritual that belonged only to them, her husband’s hands on the strings, his voice carrying the words like a vow.

Her breath caught.

The club faded. The laughter, the clink of glasses, her cousin's chatter it all dissolved. She was no longer sitting on a chair in a crowded room. She was back in the living room of their small flat, Harim sitting cross-legged with his guitar, smiling at her as though nothing in the world existed but her.

Safiya nudged her gently. “Api, you okay? It’s a nice song, isn’t it?”

Uswa didn’t answer. Her eyes glazed, lips parting in a whisper no one else heard.

Then the memory shifted.

The song bled into another night. A darker one. Gunshots tearing through the street. Harim clutching his chest, blood soaking his shirt. The man behind him... just a shadow, a figure with a weapon, the same faceless nightmare that haunted her.

Her body jerked. Her throat tightened. She clutched the edge of the table until her knuckles turned white. Panic surged like fire in her veins.

“Api!” Safiya exclaimed, alarmed, reaching for her hand.

Mahjabeen stood quickly, waving for water. “What’s happening? Uswa, breathe! Just breathe!”

But Uswa was gone, lost in the spiral of memory, her breaths shallow, eyes wide with terror. The music, the club, everything blurred into the image of her husband collapsing.

It took both cousins to steady her, whispering frantic reassurances, trying to ground her back in the present. Faces from other tables turned curiously, but they ignored the stares.

“We need to get her out of here,” Mahjabeen muttered.

They half-carried her toward the exit, Safiya’s arm tight around her shoulders. Uswa’s chest heaved, the panic clawing at her even as the cool night air met them outside.

Behind them, the song continued. Inside, the club carried on patrons laughing, Irfan’s slurred confession slipping into Samira’s phone recorder unaware that, at another table, someone else’s life had cracked open again.

---
Title: "Chapter 3 – Shadows at Night"
---

The Rizvi house had grown too quiet. Even the ticking of the old clock in the hallway seemed heavy, each beat a reminder of something pressing down on them all.

Uswa sat on the corner of her bed, knees pulled close, eyes darting toward the window as though the shadows outside were alive. Aama entered with a glass of warm milk, her brows drawn in worry.

“Beta, drink this. It will help you sleep,” Aama said softly, placing the glass on the bedside table.

Uswa shook her head, voice trembling. “No, Aama... sleep is when he comes closer. I feel him... everywhere.”

Aama sat beside her, brushing a hand over Uswa’s hair. “Who, beta? Who are you talking about?”

Uswa leaned forward, whispering so faintly that Aama had to bend down to catch her words.
“Aama... he killed Harim. He is going to kill me too.”

Aama’s face tightened. She held her daughter’s hands firmly. “Uswa, don’t say such things. You are safe here.”

Uswa’s eyes widened, glassy with fear. “Safe? No, Aama. He watches me... even now. In the walls, in the streets... when I close my eyes, he whispers. I can hear his footsteps. He’s here.”

From the doorway, Huriya had been straining to catch the words. She stepped closer, exasperated. “Apa, can you be a bit louder? I can’t hear anything from there.”

Uswa turned sharply, almost startled. “Don’t! Don’t ask me to speak louder. If I do, he’ll hear me!”

Huriya bit her lip, uneasy, and looked to Aama. “Aama, this isn’t good. She’s... not herself.”

Aama nodded, concern deepening. She pulled Uswa into her arms, rocking her gently like a child. “Beta, listen to me. We’ll go to Risha baji’s clinic. She’ll help you. Hmm?”

Uswa’s hands clutched her mother’s kurta tightly. “Now? At night?” Her eyes flickered toward the window again, as if expecting a figure to be standing there.

“Yes, now,” Aama said firmly. “We can’t wait till morning.”

Huriya, still hesitant, asked, “But Aama... is Risha baji even back home? You know she sometimes stays late at the hospital.”

“She’s home tonight,” Aama replied quickly, almost as if convincing herself. “And even if she isn’t, we’ll wait outside her house. I cannot see Uswa like this.”

Within minutes, they had wrapped shawls around themselves and stepped out into the dimly lit street. Uswa clung tightly to Aama’s arm, every shadow seeming to make her stumble. The rustle of leaves, the bark of a stray dog, the distant hum of a motorbike—all made her flinch.

When they reached Risha’s gate, Uswa’s steps faltered. She clutched Aama’s wrist. “Don’t knock, Aama. What if he’s inside already? What if he got to her too?”

Aama squeezed her hand. “Shh, beta. Nothing will happen. We are here together.”

With that, Aama lifted the latch and called softly, “Risha... are you awake?”

A light flicked on inside. Footsteps approached.

And in that moment, as the door creaked open, Uswa whispered under her breath, “He followed us.”

---

Perfect — let’s extend **Chapter 3** into **Chapter 3.2** with the new material you asked for. This section carries over the tension of the night but shifts into Risha’s calm, clinical voice while also bringing in Irfan as a parallel case.

---

The yellow glow of Risha’s hallway lamp spilled across the veranda as she opened the door, her hair tied back hastily, a shawl thrown over her shoulders. Her brows furrowed at the sight of Aama and Huriya holding Uswa between them.

“Ya Allah, what happened?” Risha whispered, immediately ushering them in.

Uswa shrank from the doorway as though it were some threshold into danger. Aama had to coax her forward.

“Come, beta. We are safe here,” Aama murmured.

Inside, Risha guided them toward her small sitting room, where a half-read medical journal lay open on the side table. She pulled the cushions together and gently made Uswa sit down.

“Uswa, look at me,” Risha said softly, her voice steady in contrast to the storm in the girl’s eyes. “You are trembling. Breathe with me... slow, like this.”

She demonstrated, inhaling and exhaling deliberately. Uswa tried, but her chest rose and fell too quickly, eyes darting toward the curtained window.

“He followed us, Risha baji,” Uswa whispered hoarsely. “I know he’s here. You can’t see him, but he’s here. He killed Harim... and I’m next.”

Risha leaned forward, clasping Uswa’s cold hands between her warm ones. “No one followed you. This is your fear talking, not reality. You are safe inside my house. Do you trust me?”

Tears spilled from Uswa’s eyes, and she nodded faintly.

Huriya folded her arms, shifting uncomfortably. “Apa, you have to speak louder. We can’t keep guessing what you’re saying.”

“Let her be, Huriya,” Risha said gently, throwing her a glance. “She doesn’t need to raise her voice. She just needs to feel heard.”

Aama sighed. “That’s what I’ve been telling her... but she won’t rest. I thought of no one but you tonight, Risha beta.”

Risha reached for a glass of water and pressed it into Uswa’s hands. “Sip this. Slowly.”

For a long moment, the room was silent except for the ticking of Risha’s wall clock. Then Risha said quietly, as though thinking aloud, “You know... this reminds me of Irfan Kaleem. He came to my clinic all the time... couldn’t write. Said he felt eyes on him all the time. Imagined someone was watching through the windows. A mind under siege by its own fears.”

Huriya’s head snapped up, curious. “The writer? The one I read?”

“Yes,” Risha confirmed, her gaze still on Uswa. “But Irfan’s fears were born of exhaustion, stress, too much pressure over his writing. He needed rest, a slower rhythm, space away from the typewriter.” She turned her attention back to Aama. “But Uswa’s case... it feels different. She’s not imagining because of fatigue. Her fear is consuming her whole being.”

Aama’s lips trembled. “Then what do we do?”

Risha smoothed Uswa’s hair, calming her. “First, she needs change. These walls, this routine, the familiar shadows, everything in Mehrabad reminds her of her fear. Take her away for a while. Somewhere with light, new air, safe company. That will help more than locking her in these fears.”

Uswa’s grip on Aama’s arm tightened. “No... no leaving. He will find me wherever I go.”

Risha shook her head firmly but kindly. “That’s what your mind is telling you. But the truth is, you need a break from these thoughts. You won’t be running away... you’ll be giving yourself a chance to breathe again.”

Huriya, arms still crossed, muttered, “She can’t even whisper without panicking... how will she handle a journey?”

“Step by step,” Risha replied calmly. “One night at a time. We’ll find a way.”

Aama drew her daughter close. “Beta, did you hear? Risha baji is right. You need a little change, even if it’s just for a while.”

Uswa closed her eyes, as if summoning courage. “If you go with me, Aama... maybe.”

Risha smiled faintly, relieved at the small crack in her resistance. “Good. That’s all we need for tonight... a maybe.”

The room fell quiet again, but this time the silence was softer, less suffocating. For the first time that night, Uswa’s breathing began to steady.

Title: "Chapter 4 – The Suggestion"
---

The evening breeze moved gently through the verandah as Aama watched her youngest granddaughter pace restlessly. Uswa’s thin frame carried a tension that no words could ease. Every few minutes, she would pause near the main gate, glance toward the road, then quickly retreat, as if the world outside had grown hostile and unfamiliar.

“Uswa beti, why don’t you go for a short walk?” Aama said, her voice carrying the soft firmness of concern. “The air will clear your mind.”

Uswa shook her head instantly. “I can’t,” she whispered.

Huriya, who had been quietly observing from the corner, rose and slipped her arm through her sister’s. “She can’t go alone, Aama. Not yet.”

And so, with Huriya beside her, Uswa allowed herself to step outside. Her grip on Huriya’s hand was tight, her eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting them to move. They made only a short round of the street, but by the time they returned, beads of sweat clung to her forehead despite the cool night.

Inside, Huriya helped her settle. The room was dim, the quiet hum of the ceiling fan filling the silence. She sat beside Uswa and, after a pause, spoke gently.

“Aama,” she said, turning toward the elder, “maybe what Uswa needs is more than just walks around the lane. She needs a change of place... a change of air.”

Aama adjusted her shawl. “What do you have in mind?”

“Gulraiz hill station,” Huriya answered at once. “It’s not too far, and it’s quiet. Fresh air, pine trees, no noise of the city... maybe she’ll feel lighter there.”

Aama considered it, her wrinkled brow furrowed with thought. Slowly, she nodded. “Perhaps you are right. Let me talk to the others.”

That night, a ripple of cautious excitement spread through the Rizvi household. The idea of leaving the heavy atmosphere behind, of escaping the suffocating walls that reminded Uswa of her grief, seemed to brighten everyone. Plans were whispered, bags pulled out, and clothes folded neatly in piles.

By dawn, the house buzzed with unusual energy. Huriya packed for both herself and Uswa, slipping in a few of her sister’s favorite shawls, while Aama made sure no one forgot the thermos of chai or the carefully wrapped parathas for the road. 

When the car pulled up to the gate, laughter replaced the usual hush of mourning. Suitcases were loaded, farewells exchanged with the neighbors, and soon the family was seated inside, the engine rumbling to life.

Uswa sat pressed close to Huriya, her hands folded in her lap in the backseat. Through the window, the streets of Mehrabad rolled past shops opening their shutters, children in uniforms hurrying to school, fruit vendors arranging their carts. Each sight slipped by like fragments of a life she could no longer reach.

She leaned her head slightly toward the glass, her eyes far away. While the rest of the family chatted, pointing out landmarks and joking over the radio, Uswa remained silent. Her reflection stared back at her from the window, pale and uncertain, while beyond it the horizon stretched toward the hills.

Huriya gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “We’re going to be fine,” she murmured.

But Uswa did not answer. She only watched the road, the trees, the unfamiliar faces, as though searching for something she feared might appear at any moment.

And so, with hope in their hearts but unease in Uswa’s eyes, the Rizvi family drove onward to Gulraiz, toward pine-scented air, toward a fragile chance of healing.

---
Title: "Chapter 5 - The Hill Station"
---

The drive wound upward into Gulraiz hill station, the car climbing through narrow bends where the air grew thinner and cooler. Mist rolled over the valley, slipping between the tall pines like restless smoke. Uswa sat pressed against the window, her eyes distant, tracing every shadow as though the mountains themselves were watching her.

Mr. Rizvi kept his hands steady on the steering wheel, the same firm calmness he had always carried. Aama and Huriya exchanged glances from the back seat, whispering occasionally to break the heavy silence. But Uswa said nothing. The journey had emptied her words, leaving only the tension in her shoulders and the unease flickering in her eyes.

By the time they reached the hill station, night had begun to push its way across the sky. Their car pulled up before a modest but welcoming hotel, its outer wall marked by a large painted emblem **The Blue Pines Hotel**. The logo, a pine tree brushed in cobalt, seemed to glow faintly in the mist.

Inside, the lobby smelled faintly of wood polish and damp earth. The family took adjoining rooms on the second floor. After settling their luggage, they ate a light meal in the small dining hall: lentil soup, warm bread, and steaming tea. Aama reminded them all to rest first, and for a few hours, the four of them drifted into uneasy sleep.

When they woke, it was past seven. The mountain air seeped in through the open window, cold and sharp. After another cup of tea, Aama suggested a short walk. Mr. Rizvi decided to remain at the hotel, tired from the drive, while Uswa, Huriya, and Aama wrapped themselves in shawls and stepped outside.

The roads were quiet, hushed by the hour. The streetlamps threw long cones of light over the cobbled path, while far below the valley glimmered faintly with scattered fires from the local villages. They walked slowly, close together, breathing in the pine-scented night.

Then, at exactly 8 o’clock, the glow changed. A sudden flare of orange rose against the dark from somewhere near the ridge. A fire.

The three of them stopped, watching as tongues of flame licked upward near an isolated lodge that sat farther down the slope. Sparks cracked into the night, and a plume of smoke climbed high, curling into the mist.

“What is that?” Huriya whispered, clutching Uswa’s arm.

“A lodge,” Aama murmured, her face pale in the firelight. “Someone must have left their hearth unattended...” But even as she said it, her voice wavered. The fire didn’t look like an accident... it was alive, growing, spreading against the dark like something that wanted to be seen.

Uswa stood transfixed. Her heart pounded so loudly it drowned the crackle of the flames. For a moment, she thought she saw movement along the ridge, something darker than the smoke, slipping between the trees.

Her breath caught. Her eyes darted, trying to follow it. The mist shifted, and the shape seemed to come closer, dragging with it the old terror that had never truly left her.

“Huriya... Aama...” she whispered, her voice breaking. “He’s here.”

Both women stiffened. “Who?” Huriya asked, frightened, but before the words left her mouth, Uswa pulled away.

She turned and ran. Down the path, past the curve of the road, her shawl fluttering like a torn wing. The forest seemed to swallow her as the fire’s glow deepened behind.

“Uswa!” Aama cried out, panic slicing through her voice. She grabbed Huriya’s hand, clutching it tightly. “Come back!”

But Uswa was already gone, the mist closing in around her.

Aama and Huriya stood trembling, the fire reflecting in their eyes, both rooted to the spot. They could still hear her footsteps pounding away into the dark until even that faded into silence.

And there, at the edge of the ridge, the two women realized they were alone.

---
Title: "Chapter 6 - The Waiting Hour"
---

The night air at Gulraiz Hill Station had grown sharp, the mist rolling down from the pine slopes like an endless tide. Lamps flickered along the cobbled paths, but to Aama every shadow looked like it could be hiding her daughter.

“Where could she have gone?” Aama whispered, clutching her shawl tightly around her shoulders as they entered the hotel lobby. The blue emblem of the **The Blue Pines Hotel** glowed faintly above the reception desk, mocking her with its calmness while her heart raced.

Huriya hurried to the counter, her voice quivering but urgent.
“Excuse me, did you see my sister? Fair skin, black hair, pale face... she must have come through.”

The receptionist, half-asleep and disinterested, shook his head. “No one like that tonight.”

Aama sighed, leaning against the desk. “She couldn’t have gone far. She doesn’t even like being alone outside.” Her words carried both worry and disbelief, as though she couldn’t imagine Uswa stepping into the dark on her own.

Mr. Rizvi came in moments later, his face lined with strain. “She’s not around the bazaar either. The shops are shutting down. It’s not safe.”

Silence hung heavy. Then Aama straightened. “We’ll search. You and I,” she told Rizvi. “If she comes back here, she must not find an empty room. Huriya will stay.”

Huriya looked at her mother, torn between fear and resolve. “But Aama...”

“No,” Aama cut her off gently. “She trusts you the most. If she returns, you must be here.”

Huriya swallowed and nodded, though her hands trembled. She sat down in the lobby lounge, her eyes fixed on the glass door. Every time it creaked open, her breath caught, but it was always strangers, a porter, a tired couple, a delivery boy. The waiting gnawed at her, minute after minute. Later she went to the room.

Up in the hills, the mist thickened. Aama and Rizvi’s voices faded as they disappeared down the stone path, their lanterns bobbing faintly like lost fireflies.

---

Back at the hotel, Huriya pressed her hands together, whispering prayers under her breath. *Ya Allah, bring her back safe...* She thought of her sister’s distant eyes on the car ride earlier, staring out the window as though trapped in another world. She had felt it too ofte. Uswa drifting somewhere unreachable.

Huriya sat by the window of the small Blue Pines Hotel room, her knees pulled close, phone clutched in her hand. She had promised Aama she would wait here, but the waiting was torture. Every sound in the hallway made her heart leap, every creak of the wooden floorboards a cruel trick.

*Where are you, Uswa?*

Her thoughts kept circling back to her sister’s pale face in the car, her vacant eyes staring out at the hills. Huriya had tried to reach her, to joke, to comfort, but Uswa had been somewhere else... somewhere unreachable. Now she was gone completely, swallowed by the night mist.

She wiped at her eyes and checked her phone again. No call. No message. Nothing.

Then, a soft knock at the door.

Huriya’s chest tightened. She rose slowly, afraid to hope. Her hand trembled on the knob as she pulled it open.

And there... framed by the dim hallway light, stood **Uswa.**

Her hair clung damply to her temples, her face pale, her body sagging as though she had been carried by sheer willpower.

“Uswa?” Huriya’s voice cracked, the word breaking halfway.

Her sister stumbled forward, collapsing against her shoulder with a sob. The relief hit so hard Huriya nearly buckled under the weight. She held Uswa tightly, feeling the shivers running through her body, afraid that if she let go, she would lose her again.

But then, another presence.

Huriya lifted her head, her tear-stung eyes locking onto the man who stood beside Uswa. For a heartbeat, her mind refused to believe it. She knew that face. She had stared at it on book covers, memorized every word of his stories, whispered his sentences like prayers in the quiet of her room.

Her lips parted in disbelief.
“Oh my God… you’re Irfan Kaleem. The writer.”

The words tumbled out before she could stop them. She tightened her grip on Uswa, then stepped aside in a rush. “Please—please come inside. Aama and Abba are out looking for her. They’ll be back soon.”

Irfan inclined his head, his gaze steady but gentle as he looked at the trembling girl still clinging to him. “You can leave my hand now,” he said softly. “You’re safe here.”

But Uswa would not let go. She pressed her forehead deeper into Huriya’s shoulder, clutching both of them as if reality itself would dissolve without their touch.

Huriya’s throat tightened as she guided them inside, her hand fumbling for her phone. She had to call her parents, let them know.

The door rattled behind her.

She froze, phone still in hand, as it swung open.

Aama and Mr. Rizvi stood in the doorway, faces drawn with exhaustion from the long search. For a moment, their eyes didn’t register Irfan at all. They saw only their daughter.

“Uswa…” Aama whispered, her hands flying to her mouth.

And Huriya felt Uswa stir against her, lifting her head slowly, still trembling.

The room seemed to stop breathing. Relief, disbelief, and a strange, impossible truth hung in the air: her sister had returned alive, safe and with her stood the most unlikely man in Gulraiz.

---
Title: "Chapter 7 - The Writer’s Exit"
---

The living room had gone strangely quiet after the chaos of Uswa’s trembling return. Aama sat across from Irfan, still processing the look she had seen in her daughter’s eyes—terror so raw it felt contagious.

Irfan rose, brushing the dust from his sleeves, his voice low but firm.
“Ma’am, I have to go. But I suggest you keep an eye on her. She was so scared. You should go to the police.”

Aama’s heart skipped. She understood exactly what he meant... he believed the danger wasn’t imagined, that it had weight, shape, and footsteps in the night. She opened her mouth to speak, to beg him to stay a little longer, but before she could say a word, he was gone. The door clicked softly behind him, yet the absence echoed louder than his presence.

Uswa slipped past her mother in silence, her scarf half-unraveled, her face drained of expression. Without a word, she went straight into the bedroom and collapsed onto the bed. The exhaustion in her movements was heavier than sleep itself... it was surrender.

Huriya, standing by the window, watched the streetlamp shadows trembling across the road. Her brow furrowed as her thoughts spilled out aloud.
“How did she end up with *him*... my favorite writer of all people?” She hugged her arms close, as if hugging her own confusion. “I wish he’d stayed. I have so many questions I wanted to ask him.”

Her words weren’t accusing, but curious and tinged with a mix of admiration and disbelief. Irfan, the name printed on the covers of her books, the figure she had only known in her imagination, had walked into their house, spoken to her family, and left like a phantom.

Aama turned her gaze toward her youngest daughter. Uswa had curled onto her side, her fists clenched around the bedsheet, breath slowing into restless slumber. Aama’s chest tightened. She smoothed a hand gently over Uswa’s hair, brushing the strands away from her damp forehead.

“Let her sleep,” Aama whispered, more to herself than to anyone else. She knew her daughter’s nightmares had only just begun.

Behind her, Huriya remained in the doorway, silent now, her eyes still fixed on the empty space Irfan had left behind.

The night pressed close around the house, thick and watchful.

Title: "Chapter 8 – Broken Reflections"
---

The return from Gulraiz Hill Station had been quiet, almost too quiet. The mountain air that once felt fresh and cleansing was already fading into memory as the family’s car rolled back into the familiar streets of Mehrabad. Aama seemed relieved to be home again, while Huriya carried the same restless energy as always. Uswa, however, had been wrapped in silence for days, her eyes following shadows more than people, her words barely escaping her lips.

A week passed. Life in Mehrabad began to slip back into its usual rhythm, the sound of the milkman’s bell in the morning, the neighborhood children shouting in the street, the calls of street vendors drifting through the air. Yet inside their house, there was a strange unease, like the walls were holding their breath.

Something had shifted outside their circle, and it was impossible to ignore.

Irfan’s new book had exploded into the market. Bookstores in the city kept his novel displayed front and center; reviews in newspapers praised him as “a daring storyteller with a fearless pen.” The whispers of readers spread faster than wildfire, and the name *Irfan Khan* seemed to be on everyone’s tongue.

Inside their home, however, the news felt less like triumph and more like betrayal.

Huriya was the first to bring it up.

“He is quite fast,” she said one afternoon, her voice laced with a sharpness that wasn’t just admiration. She was holding a paperback copy of Irfan’s book, its spine already creased from her restless flipping. She tapped the cover with her fingernail. “But...”

She paused, eyes flicking toward her sister.

Uswa sat in the corner, her scarf pulled tightly around her shoulders, head lowered as though she could shield herself from the world by shrinking into silence. The weak afternoon light came in through the half-drawn curtains, falling across her face in fractured stripes.

Huriya took a step closer, her expression tightening. “Apa. See. He wrote your story. He even wrote the names.”

The words cut through the silence like a sudden storm.

“I’ve read it,” Huriya continued, though her voice wavered. “He talks nasty about you and...” She hesitated, biting down on her lip before forcing the words out. “...and Harim bhai.”

For a heartbeat, everything froze. Even the ticking of the old wall clock seemed to vanish.

Uswa’s hand shot forward, snatching the book from Huriya’s grip. Her fingers tightened around it as though she could crush the pages into dust.

And then, like a dam bursting, something inside Uswa cracked.

Her eyes blazed, her shoulders trembled, and her voice rose, loud, sharp, alive. “How the hell would he do something like this!”

The shout startled even her. For weeks she had spoken in whispers, her words fragile as glass. Now they came out raw, jagged, undeniable.

Huriya tilted her head, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Oh wow, you can speak loud. Impressive.”

From across the room, Aama looked at her. She didn’t understand what had happened, but somewhere inside she felt a quiet happiness because at last, she had heard the true voice of her daughter.

Huriya's remark stung, but it didn’t matter. The silence Uswa had hidden behind was gone, shattered.

She stood suddenly, her scarf slipping from her shoulder, and began to pace the room. Her steps were restless, uneven. Her hands clenched and unclenched as if they were searching for something to hold onto.

“Harim...” she whispered under her breath, the name escaping before she could stop it.

For a moment, she was no longer in the dim little living room of Mehrabad. She was back in another time, in the memory of Harim’s laughter as he carried groceries through the door, the way he would tease her about her silence, the warmth of his hand brushing against hers when no one was looking. She remembered his eyes, gentle but steady, how they had always made her feel safe.

Her fingers flew over the pages, flipping faster, her eyes scanning the words. With each line her face grew tighter, her breathing harsher.

“What the hell is this?” she spat, slamming a page flat with her palm. “Lies... everywhere! He twists my life like some dirty game. And Harim...” her voice broke, rising again, “how dare he write about him like this?”

She turned another page, her hands trembling but fierce. “This isn’t his story to tell. Not mine. Not Harim’s. Damn him for thinking he owns it!”

Her scarf slipped off her shoulder as she stood, pacing, muttering curses half under her breath and half out loud. “Shameless man… using my pain… my love… like entertainment for strangers. Damn him!”

Huriya exchanged a glance with Aama. Neither spoke.

Aama’s face was unreadable at first, but behind her eyes there was something almost tender. She didn’t understand the details of the words Uswa was throwing, but she knew one thing: for the first time in so long, her daughter’s voice was alive—sharp, angry, and full.

And that, in its own way, felt like healing.

Here’s **Chapter 8.2** written in your style and notes — keeping it as a continuation from the previous heated scene but also giving it a natural flow.

---

“Calm down, beta,” Aama finally said, her voice gentle but firm, trying to pull Uswa back from the edge.

“No, Aama!” Uswa shot back, her chest heaving. Her grip on the book was so tight her knuckles whitened. “How could he say this bullshit about me and Harim?”

Huriya opened her mouth, almost carefully, as if she wanted to soften the blow. “Apa, maybe he...”

“Bla. Bla. Bla!” Uswa cut her off, her voice rising. She tossed the book onto the table with a thud. “He was just...” she stopped for a moment, her lips trembling, then spat, “Your favorite writer is an asshole.”

She turned, pacing two steps toward her room, her scarf trailing behind her. “I am going to do something about this Irfan. How could he...” Her voice broke into fragments, fury and disbelief tangled together.

Then, without another word, she stormed towards her room, the sound of her footsteps echoing into the silence.

For a moment, Aama and Huriya simply stared after her. And then, unexpectedly, both broke into laughter. Not cruel laughter, but a release, like something heavy had lifted. For in Uswa’s anger, in her raw, unfiltered words, they caught a glimpse of the old Uswa, the one they thought they had lost.

Title: "Chapter 9 - Towards the Writer"
---

Uswa sat cross-legged on her bed, the soft glow of her phone screen lighting up her face. Her brows were drawn tight, eyes scanning line after line of search results. Every click, every refresh carried the same intent... finding him. Irfan Kaleem.

The name pulsed in her mind like a wound that refused to close. Finally, a link gave her what she wanted: an address scribbled into the small notepad she kept beside her pillow. She tore the page out, folded it sharply, and slipped it into her bag.

Her movements grew swift, deliberate. She reached for the small backpack leaning against her wardrobe, stuffing in a scarf, her charger, and a half-folded notebook. Zipping it shut, she swung it over her shoulder, her breath quickening with a strange mix of anger and courage.

Downstairs, the house carried its usual late-evening hush. The ceiling fan whirred, the faint clink of cups from the kitchen drifted in, but in the hallway Aama and Huriya stood in quiet conversation. Uswa’s steps broke their rhythm, her presence sharp enough to draw both their eyes at once.

From the far end of the hall, Risha appeared, adjusting her dupatta as she walked toward them. Her gaze landed on Uswa, and a crease of confusion softened into surprise.

“Uswa...” Risha slowed, her voice warm but wary. “Where are you going?”

Uswa’s grip tightened on her backpack straps. “Baji... that writer—” her voice trembled, then hardened, “...Irfan Kaleem. He did a really nasty thing. I’m going to talk to him.”

Before anyone could answer, she raised her voice, sharp and commanding in a way that silenced the hall.

“Aaba! Give me your car keys!”

The words hung heavy. Even Aama flinched at the sudden edge in her tone. Risha blinked, stunned, her mouth parting slightly as if to ask something... but she didn’t. She looked instead at Aama, then Huriya, her expression a storm of disbelief and wonder.

How? How had Uswa gone from trembling in shadows to this bold defiance? It didn’t make sense. But alongside her shock, something stirred in Risha’s chest... a fragile, secret relief. For the first time in she heard Uswa sounded alive after a very long time.

Aaba’s hand appeared from the sitting room doorway, keys dangling on a ring. He didn’t argue, didn’t question. Uswa snatched them, the metallic jingle clattering through the tense silence, and without another word, she marched toward the door.

The slam echoed through the house as she stepped outside. The sound lingered like a crack in glass.

Risha let out a shaky breath and turned to the others. Her voice dropped low, urgent. “We need to talk to Irfan. I’ve got a plan.”

Aama frowned. “Plan? What plan?”

Risha’s eyes didn’t leave the door. Her tone was steady, though a flicker of hope gleamed beneath it. “If he really did something wrong, then confronting him isn’t just about answers. It might... it might bring her back completely. If Uswa stands up to him, maybe the old Uswa... the one we lost... will return.”

For a moment, no one spoke. The hall was filled only with the hum of the fan and the faint echo of car tires crunching gravel outside.

Aama’s lips pressed into a thin line, worry written deep in her features. Huriya clutched the end of her scarf, eyes darting between them all. But Risha’s words hung there, undeniable, like a thread of possibility woven into the air.

Somewhere beyond their walls, Uswa was already on her way... keys in hand, fire in her chest, toward Irfan Kaleem.

And none of them knew whether she was walking toward healing... or disaster.

---

The silence in the hallway pressed down like a weight. Aama’s worried sigh seemed to echo off the walls. Huriya shifted uncomfortably, twisting the edge of her dupatta in her fingers.

“Do we follow her?” Huriya finally asked, her voice soft but trembling.

Risha’s eyes stayed fixed on the closed door, the faint sound of the car starting outside sending a chill down her spine. She shook her head slowly.
“No...” she said firmly. “I will call him.”

Before Aama or Huriya could question her, Risha had already pulled out her phone. Her hands trembled, but her resolve was steady. She scrolled quickly, found his number, and pressed call.

The line rang once. Twice. Then a click.

“Hello.” came the voice on the other end, rough with suspicion.

Risha didn’t waste a second. “Hey! Irfan... listen.” Her tone was urgent, low, and deliberate. “Uswa is coming to your house. No need to tell her anything. Just... just say it was a treatment. None of this is true. Say *Risha told me to do it.* I will handle the rest.”

There was a pause on the line, and then Irfan’s confused voice: “Treatment? What are you...”

“Please!” Risha cut him off sharply. “I don’t have time to explain. Just do what I say. If you fight her, if you argue, you’ll break her. But if you go along... it might fix her. It might give her a way back to herself.”

Irfan went silent, and she could hear the faint static of his breath through the receiver.

Before ending the call, Risha’s voice softened, pleading now:
“Please, Irfan... do not get angry. Even if she slaps you, even if she screams. Just believe me. Someone tried to destroy her life. And right now, you... you have a chance to save her.”

The line held for a heartbeat, then Irfan’s quiet agreement came:
“...Okay.”

Risha closed her eyes, exhaling the breath she had been holding, and hung up.

Behind her, Aama whispered, “Ya Allah, guide them both.”

And somewhere down the road, Uswa drove straight into the storm they had just set in motion.

---
Title: "Chapter 10 – The Knock at Midnight"
---

The headlights of the car cut through the silent street, throwing long shadows across the rows of shuttered houses. Uswa’s grip on the steering wheel was so tight her knuckles turned pale. Her chest heaved, fury boiling over into trembling exhaustion. She pressed the brakes hard, the car screeched, and she stopped right in front of Irfan’s house.

Without a second thought, she stumbled out, her dupatta trailing behind her. She stormed up the small staircase and began pounding on the wooden door with her fists.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Inside, Irfan had just set his phone aside, mind heavy but steady with the instructions Risha had given him. The pounding startled him. He opened the door slowly, only to be met with Uswa’s burning, tear-filled eyes.

“Oh...” she spat, her voice sharp with disbelief. “Mr. Irfan. The lodge guy.”

Before he could even respond, her voice broke into a shout:

“I thought you were not like other guys!” she screamed, words tumbling out between ragged breaths. “How the hell did you lie about me and Harim?”

Irfan tried to step back, keeping his face as calm as possible. “Uswa, please. It was...”

“Don’t you dare say my name!” she cut him off. “You played with my pain! You... you wrote it down like some kind of cheap story. Did you think I wouldn’t find out?”

Her hands shook as she jabbed a finger at him. “I trusted you for one moment. One! And you made me a spectacle.”

Irfan swallowed, forcing himself to remember Risha’s words: *Don’t argue. Say it was for a treatment. Just let her blame you. I’ll handle the rest.*

So he stood still, silent, taking the blows of her words like stones hurled at him.

“You disgust me!” she shouted, her voice cracking. “I thought you were different... better than the rest. But you’re a liar. A selfish, shameless liar!”

She raised her hand to slap him... but it faltered halfway. Her body swayed, knees buckling. Exhaustion drained her strength. Before she could collapse against the doorframe, Irfan caught her.

“Uswa!” His voice shook. He lowered her gently to the ground, panic flooding through him. Her eyelids fluttered closed.

Heart racing, he fumbled for his phone and dialed Risha. She picked up instantly.

“She fainted,” he blurted out, his voice desperate. “I promise I did nothing. What do I do now?”

On the other side, Risha’s tone was firm but calm. “I believe you. Listen to me carefully, Irfan. I’m sending you the location. Bring her back safely. Right now.”

The call ended. A map notification buzzed onto his screen.

Irfan looked at the unconscious girl in his arms, the weight of the night pressing on him heavier than ever. He took a deep breath, then gathered her gently, stepping out into the still, silent street.

The story was only tightening around him.

--- 

Irfan struggled to steady his breath as he carried Uswa’s limp figure toward her car. The keys had fallen from her hand earlier; he found them on the seat and slid into the driver’s side, adjusting her carefully beside him.

“Wow,” he muttered under his breath as he ran his hands over the steering wheel. “Tiny and cute.”

The engine roared to life, and he drove through the quiet streets, every passing light making his nerves tighten. By the time he stopped in front of Uswa’s house, his shirt was damp with sweat.

He stepped out, scooped her back into his arms, and knocked firmly on the wooden door.

The door opened almost immediately. Risha stood there, her eyes scanning the scene without surprise. She gestured quickly. “Bring her in.”

Inside, the air was heavy but calm. Irfan carried Uswa up to the lounge where Risha and Huriya were waiting. They gently took her from him and guided her upstairs, into her room.

He lingered behind, silent, heart pounding, until the door clicked shut.

---

Half an hour later, the muffled sound of shifting sheets stirred the quiet house. Uswa’s voice broke through, raw and furious:

“Where is that asshole!”

Irfan, who had been leaning against the doorframe of her room, stiffened. Just a few feet away stood Aama, watching her daughter with quiet, worried eyes. Irfan took a slow step forward and said softly, “I am here.”

Before his voice had even faded, Risha shot him a sharp glance. “Just keep your mouth shut,” she murmured under her breath, warning him.

Uswa’s eyes blazed. She tried to push herself off the bed, staggering as though her rage alone fueled her body. But before she could launch at him, Huriya and Risha steadied her, holding her gently but firmly.

“Calm down, sweetie,” Risha soothed, her tone deliberately low and steady. “It was a treatment. I told him to write that. Look...” She gestured around, nodding reassuringly. “You are good now.”

Uswa’s breath came in gasps, her anger colliding with confusion. Risha leaned closer, her eyes steady.

“Tell me,” she asked softly. “Do you see that man who was trying to kill you?”

The question caught Uswa off guard. For a moment, her face went blank, searching. Then she let out a sharp breath, almost a laugh.

“Naa... He was in jail, I know. How can he kill me?”

Relief rippled across the room. Huriya turned to glance at Aama, her eyes shining with a small, cautious hope. Aama’s expression softened, lips trembling with the hint of a smile.

“See?” Risha said gently, squeezing Uswa’s hand. “It was what we all decided... to push you back to normal.”

Huriya, Aama, and even the hesitant Irfan echoed together, voices overlapping:

“Yaa.”

The room fell into a strange hush... one that felt like victory, but also something darker, as if the treatment had worked a little too perfectly.

---

The room behind them settled into silence, broken only by Uswa’s uneven breathing. Risha closed the door gently, her hand resting on the knob for a moment before she turned to Irfan.

He exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “Now I have to take the rickshaw or a cab,” he muttered, almost to himself.

Before Risha could reply, a voice cut in from the hallway.
“I’ll drop you,” Huriya said, stepping forward with a small, steady smile. “I know how to drive.”

Irfan glanced at her, surprised but relieved. “That’s good.”

They started down the stairs together, the wooden steps creaking softly under their weight. But Huriya’s tone shifted as soon as they reached the lounge.

“But this...” she said, her brow furrowed, eyes narrowing on Irfan. “This wasn’t a treatment. I’ve read all of your novels. This doesn’t look like your style at all. Why did you do that?”

Risha drew in a breath, her lips parting. “I’ll tell you the real story—”

But Irfan cut her off sharply, raising his hand slightly. “No.” He locked eyes with Huriya, his voice low but firm. “Come drop me. We’ll have a coffee, and I’ll tell you the whole thing there.”

For a beat, the air hung heavy between them. Then Huriya gave a short nod. “Okay... let’s go.”

The front door creaked open, the cool night air sweeping in. Irfan followed her outside, leaving Risha standing in the dim light of the hallway, watching them both disappear into the night.

---
Title: "Chapter 11 – Coffee and Confessions"
---

The evening air was cool, carrying the faint hum of traffic and the scent of dust after a long, dry day. Huriya drove steadily, her hands loose on the steering wheel, when Irfan leaned back in his seat and broke the silence and was on their way back.

“Let’s stop at that café,” he said suddenly, nodding toward a small roadside café with warm light spilling through its windows.

Huriya gave him a sideways glance, half a smile tugging at her lips. “Coffee at this hour?”

“Trust me,” he replied, “we both need it.”

She pulled the car over, and they stepped inside. The café was quiet, almost drowsy, with only a few students scribbling in notebooks. The clatter of cups and the hiss of the coffee machine filled the room, wrapping them in a cocoon of warmth and silence.

Inside, the café was quiet, only a few students hunched over notebooks. They chose a corner table near the window. The clatter of cups and the hiss of the coffee machine filled the silence between them until Irfan finally leaned forward, elbows on the table.

“When I first saw Uswa,” he began, voice low, “I was... curious. There was something about her fear that didn’t make sense. Not just a girl running from shadows. Something heavier.”

Huriya studied him carefully. “Curious? Or obsessed?”

He half-smiled. “Maybe both.” He stirred the foam in his cup. “But I didn’t jump into writing her story blindly. I called Risha. He told me Harim’s killer was already in jail. That detail... among other things, gave me a hook. I thought, *what if the story wasn’t about Harim, or Uswa, but about the idea of fear itself?* That’s when the novel began to take shape.”

“But you used their names,” Huriya said.

“No,” Irfan shook his head. “I didn’t. Not once. I made sure. The names, the settings... I changed them all. It wasn’t Uswa. It wasn’t Harim. It was fiction.” He hesitated, then let out a tired breath. “At least I thought so.”

Huriya’s voice grew tight. “I was the one who showed her... I read your novel, Irfan. I told Uswa what was written in it. The way you twisted Harim’s death, the ugly details... it was impossible for her to control herself.”

“That’s the part I can’t explain.” He rubbed his temple. “The day I finished the draft, I woke up in the evening and I went out for a walk. Needed to clear my head. By the time I was heading back to the lodge, my phone rang... it was Zameer, my agent. He said I already sent him the manuscript.”

Her eyes widened. “But you hadn’t sent it.”

“Exactly. I wanted to reread it first. Maybe even talk to Uswa before making a decision. But somehow... it was already in his inbox.” He paused, staring out the glass window.

Huriya remembered Uswa’s trembling voice, the way she had snapped at her earlier. She looked down, suddenly guilty.

“She clung to me like I was her last chance,” Irfan continued. “And for a moment, I thought maybe this was more than just a story. Maybe... someone wanted it to become real.”

They sat in silence, the hum of the café pressing around them.

Huriya broke it. “You think someone leaked it on purpose? Maybe to trap her?”

“Or me.” His lips tightened. “I don’t know who, or why. But it wasn’t an accident.”

The waitress dropped off their bill, and they both rose. Outside, gets colder than before. The drive back was quiet until they reached Irfan’s neighborhood.

He turned to her as she parked. “Huriya.” His voice was gentler now. “You have an eye for detail. You don’t hesitate to challenge me. That’s rare.”

She blinked. “What are you trying to say?”

“I want you to be my editor.” His lips curved slightly. “Help me make sense of this mess.”

For a moment, she said nothing. Inside, her chest tightened with a strange warmth... half pride, half fear. She had always admired his work, dreamed of being part of something bigger than just reading it. But her face remained calm.

“I’ll... think about it,” she said lightly, as if brushing off the weight of the offer.

He smiled knowingly. “Fair enough.”

As he stepped out of the car, Huriya watched him walk toward his door. A flicker of excitement sparked in her chest despite herself. She knew she would not be able to say no.

And yet, something gnawed at her... if the novel was already in Zameer’s hands without Irfan sending it... who else was pulling the strings?

The night felt heavy again, as though the story had already moved ahead of all of them.
